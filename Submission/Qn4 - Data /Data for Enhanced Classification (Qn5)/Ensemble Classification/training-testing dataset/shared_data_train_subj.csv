140,Instead of leaving a review i would rather talk to the owner of the company in person. I think that way he would have a full understanding on whats going on in the company.,0
611,"RemX has multiple positions available to choose from, they have a friendly work environment, and great trainers to assist you with your new duties. The best part of working with RemX was that the office staff always returned my messages/emails in a professional and timely manner.",1
172,The work is very easy to complete and understand. There can be quite a bit of downtime so if you don't get along with your coworkers you probably won't survive the slow days.,0
108,Best management I've ever had and everyone is there to help each other succeed! There are so many opportunities to move up and so many people to help you achieve your goals. It can be challenging but it keeps the job interesting!,1
1072,Very boring just picking products for 10 straight hours. Money is good 13.50 a hour but then you donât really have anything to do the rest of your day. 4 days a week so thatâs good. The days go by fast ,0
782,"Working in the Navy will turn a teenager in a grown up. There are tons of things to do and tons of things expected of you. If you are ready, you can excel.",0
1000,The work is good but really stressful for beginners. I do not recommend this job for anyone who have no previous experience in kitchen. The crew and team members were ok. Fast paced environment BEWARE! I DO NOT RECOMMEND WORKING HERE FOR BEGINNERS!,0
678,No experience needed with many types of training and lots of learning opportunities. Lots of opportunity for growth and advancement within the company. Great benefits. Pays above minimum wage with great raises. Treats employees fairly.,1
627,"Typically day consists of putting stuff away, dealing with customers. The workplace energy was weird at times. Hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers and listening to managers.",0
55,Staff and employees are friendly. They have a cafeteria for employees. I enjoyed working for my day shift supervisor. Overall a great experience. Would recommend.,1

557,Over all the company is a good place to work. I worked as a home office employee remotely assigned to a field office. The expectations were set forth from day one by my home office management however it seemed the local field office was never on the same page. The people were great in both offices. I was woefully underpaid for what I was expected to do and hence I left. Additionally in the position I was in there was no room for advancement unless I moved to Wisconsin.,0
1095,"I have worked here for 2 years. I have contributed an above average amount of work and also led my department in successful improvements to our systems and processes. Since i've started my responsibilities and workload has increased drastically requiring me to sacrifice a lot of personal time and work excessive overtime. My pay has not changed. The management has taken my work and efforts for granted and hardly acknowledged any of my efforts. This situation can be applied to MANY others who share the same view. Once you reach about 2-3yrs with this company most people leave to work somewhere else because of the same sentiment. Because it looks good on their resume they are able to find substantially better jobs elsewhere which is a big benefit, but most people leave because they are underpaid and overworked. You also need to be here at least 3 years before you're able to take ownership of the full amount in your 401k. Otherwise you forfeit a substantial amount of what the company matches at 4%.",1

270,Communication is zero within the company. I started working at teleperformance November 2020 and i have had issues with replacing my equipment its been one issue after another and i am yet to complete training and actually work. I feel like i have wasted my time being there. ,1
572,Can be busy at times but overall a cool place to work. Especially when you get along with the other staff/employees. They are pretty flexible with you on hours as well.,0
523,Horrible company to work for. They don't respect their employees. They treat them as if they are all replaceable. Overall it was the worst job I've had by far.,1
434,I have worked in call centers for a number of years and the one common denominator between all call centers is attrition. Attrition it's something that happens all the time but doesn't have to happen all the time One of the reasons for this w/o attrition The training departments would cease to exist However. I love my job.It would be nice if teammates and supervisors were nice ad well,0
774,"I'm definitely a veteran delivery driver and I know how to do my job the best a driver could. Despite this, the driver market is far over-saturated and on top of that the customers will act so nice, but never tip you. And if they do, they seem to have forgotten and tip you a week later when they order delivery again. I feel completely duped, especially during the pandemic when nobody should have to work so hard for so little. I always knew it could only be a part time job, but ever since being laid off it's all I've had to make money and I get more irritated with the job with each passing day. Postmates is a ripoff.",0
1027,"They do not care about their employees hire management only care about money and the corporate office condones it. They allow managers to treat their employees like cattle, even when there is a complaint. The HR representative claims to be neutral but are not they always look out for the company not the employee no matter if there is wrong doing. ",1
991,"If you have an accounting degree, this job and dept is not for you. You will learn nothing in this job, management is terrible since they never have any idea of what is going on. Only way to get ahead is a** kissing (like majorily) sometimes you can show up late and give your boss a gift card to compensate the unprofessional behavior and that gift card is also pathetically accepted. That should tell you a lot of the dept culture. Unrealistic deadlines, LOTS of favoritism, in certain teams - one specific team can not retain any females as the director is a female herself and cannot get along with any females. Reported behavior goes unheard. Stay away.",1
1074,Management always preaches that they value life work balance but requires you to work 26 days straight to get 2 days off most of the time even when there is no work. Most everything the managers say only pertains to them and not the floor workers. ,1
941,"My supervisor is a wonderful person who has repeatedly gone out of their way for those of us having a hard time after the changes. However it doesn't seem like the rest of management cares about anything other than the bottom line. They have recently doubled the workload due to covid 19 and poor attendance, effectively punishing those of us who show up ready to work every day. In the beginning they told us it was temporary- but this was back in June. September is almost done and its still a waking nightmare to work here. I just want my old job back, when everything was normal. Its obvious that greedy management is enjoying the extra productivity because they show no signs of rolling back the changes.Before all that, the work/ life balance was horrible. I was willing to put up with it regardless but its 12 hour shifts and you work 14 out of 28 days unless you need the extra hours, which they are always happy to give you(a big plus.) The other shifts routinely leave you a mess meaning you will be stuck with part of their job and all of yours. With the increased workload lately I find it nearly impossible to get all my work done in the amount of time expected- and I am one of the faster workers. I have worked almost every shift without breaks for the last few months and I'm burned out.Being deployed was easier than the abuse I put up with at work.",1
17,Of was not laid off I would have stayed there the benefits and pay are great and the culture is not bad usually busy all the time so you donât feel how quick the days pass it can get really stressful especially at month ends and quarterly,0
989,"I mad slot of money working here and as long as you work hard and don't call in you do as they say you might have a chance to move up but they will first promote their family and friends even if I work harder. Seen that happen to many people over a 10 year time. I had to fight hard to keep my job under a lot of prejudice minded bosses. I would not go back but it helped while I was single and young. I hope that single minded leadership changed since then,if so it would be a great place to work",1
183,"There is a lot of opportunity for career advancement at this company. What makes it hard is itâs all about who you know. Networking would be the best way to advance your career, but most of the time the people hired for higher paying positions are those that have closer relationships with the hiring manager. ",0
229,"Work, they want you to work, low pay but high demands, need a job? Youâll probably never get fired there. So why not go over there if you donât wanna get fired. ",0
226,"I worked at Aramark in Newark, De for 3 years. Thereâs favoritism towards employees, the pay was good but management was severely unorganized. Then thereâs seniority which is fine, except the older people didnât do the work they were supposed to but, would still get precedence.You do get benefits & are a union member if youâre a full time employee.",0
922,"Been working there for over four years as a fleet mechanic. Very little room for advancement. If you are considered a frontline employee, you will only be considered for low level advancement positions even if you meet or exceed all position requirements for mid-level positions. They will require relocation if you want to advance as well. Positions are filled internally by who knows who (the clique) and who can benefit me. I work for managers who cannot do their jobs and constantly ask me for help. Though I cannot move into management positions due to being a frontline employee. ",1
914,"I took a long time to be officially hired there. I was a consultant for over two and a half years. Overall, I enjoyed working there. I found the hours to be extremely long. Since I don't have a family, I didn't mind this but would certainly have an issue if I had small children at home. On the plus side, the culture is the overall pretty flexible meaning if you have to step out for an hour or so, that's perfectly fine.",1
612,A lot of hard work and long days stressful at times but if you do your job quickly and safely money is great. Most of coworkers are easy to work with.,0
282,I worked with touchpoint for 9 months. During that time I mostly enjoyed myself. Didn't really interact with coworkers or staff much because they were racist and stupid. Upper management didn't understand or care about the problems of the underlings. The fact we were understaffed and whatnot. They had some real winners employed there. They have the bar set so low that anyone can work there. No attention to detail. Surprised half the hospital doesn't have covid. If you like doing the job of 2 for a lousy 13 bucks an hour than touchpoint is the job for you! Adam in Stevens Point is a supremely inept manager who has no business delegating others.,1
29,"Pros: professional development opportunities (inc. trainings), equitable pay and benefits, friendly and supportive staff who care about the work they do Cons: rigid grants",0
628,this no longer company and thats for the better the pay was horrible and no room for growth in the company. the company has been shutdown for about a year,1

833,"This place should be shut down, everyday we would talk about safety, but for what all they want to do is move their product they donât care about safety. Also Branch managers need training to become team leaders take suggestions not someone that will say itâs my way or the highway. ",1

278,"If you have a love for animals, this is the place to work. I truly enjoyed working with the animals and getting to take care of them. Most of the associates strive for a good working environment and to provide the best care for the animals and the customers. The management in Twin Falls, Idaho is not the best, but is not terrible. Some management cares for its employees and other management can be toxic. The other downfalls to the positions at Petsmart is the pay and hours. I always strive to provide the best customer service and quality work. After a year of continuously asking for a pay raise or to become a full-time employee instead of part-time, nothing ever changed except for an increased work load. Now that I have quit my position there, I am making a better wage with less physical labor.",0
479,This job was very overwhelming. I was thrown into the waters very early on in my training. The work-life balance is TERRIBLE and the benefits suck!!!!,1
194,Great company to work for. I left a job making more money to work for this company. I really look forward to making a career here. You are allowed to make as much overtime as you would like. I average 60 hours per week and 68 if i come in and work on Saturday for 8 hours.,1
999,"This place worries more about the children than the employees. They pay you low wages and work you to near death. Also, thereâs a lot of unprofessionalism with management and administration. The only reason I stayed was because of the amazing children. ",1
214,"Working at Goldman Sachs can be considered a privilege even if its lost some of its historical cache. The company is clearly trying to put its best foot forward towards a more ""modern"" culture, but in my experience has suffered from significant turnover. Banking division remains best in class.",0
775,"CVS took Aetna downhill. Took holidays, changed pto and vacation, took our yearly incentive towards our HSA and now it comes in your check each pay. Lots of people now working at home so the office is a ghost town ",0

577,Kiewit is a great company that is willing to help you build your knowledge and experience safely and time efficiently. Teaching safety first and everyone leaves safely.,1
568,Lower staff are treated as disposable by upper management. No sense of community or support in the workforce as staff are more intimidated into fearing their own job security than feeling a sense of achievement in their role. ,1

486,Shaw is a pretty good place to work. Each plant however is run differently and there is now continuity in how all plants are run. It is an inclusive environment.,1
329,"Can set your own hours within parameters they set. Experience will vary widely depending on program and your manager. It can be relaxed or require hours upon hours of unpaid training per week. No call centre micro managing which is a huge plus but there is no pay for downtime, training or writing notes. The metrics are also absurd and the training is minimal you basically just get stuck in a job and have to figure it out before you get fired.",0

445,"The univ of wash was a good place to work. They had good benefits but, if you were not up high on the ladder then they also Were not as nice.. Had places to park although it has gotten farther and farther away due to construction",0
11,I worked with Marriott rewards. Benefits were okay. Clock in and clock out type of job. Be on time and wonât get fired. No type of bonuses but be ready to work holidays,0
1046,I really do not feel I can give a fair assessment. I left in 2003 and I'm not sure if that department still exists. It was an ok place to work. I knew I wasn't going to retire from there. I have no idea who the CEO is.,0
970,Pretty easy job the training is not paid but you do get to work from home the training is long you get to pick your own hours that you want to work most jobs you have to work 5 weekend hours,0
64,"Nothing but a bunch of sheep. Management is prejudice as frick! Donât be a conservative at a construction supply company? Got hired based off of my disability and fired for it!

143,If you do your job correctly its a fast paced job with great regulars and good employees that are just fun. Sometimes it can get a little stressful but you just need to breath and remember that your doing the best you can. It can get busy when your by yourself and you have to make food and coffees for people especially big orders but customers understand as long as you acknowledge that they are there.,0
879,Challenging place to work but also very rewarding. Must be flexible with your hours due to the demands of the job 24/7. Operations manager does have a nice mix of office related work and more physical related warehouse work. ,0
147,"It's a very average job. It's not horrible, but it's not amazing either. If you're looking for a temporary job, this is probably a good option for you. Most in stores work dinner rushes, so in a typical day at work you'll most likely be assigned to either the makeline or the front. On makeline you'll just be making pizzas and putting them in the oven. It's not hard work after your first week, and you'll have all of the recipes memorized within 2 weeks. If you forget something, there's laminates posted on the wall to help you out. If it's really busy, you might be assigned to cut. All you have to do is take pizzas (and other items) out of the oven, put them in the box, cut them/sauce them, and put them on the hot rack. Cut can be stressful because the conveyor belt oven doesn't stop, so if you wait too long the pizza will fall on the floor. Finally there's the front of the store, where you'll be responsible for answering phones, doing curbside service (during covid), putting stickers on boxes, etc. Also not hard work, but the system isn't great so it's easy to make mistakes. (For example, if a customer places an online/phone order and chooses to pay when they arrive, the order will be marked as cash. If they give you a card when they arrive, you have to delete the cash option and put in the card, but if you accidentally complete the order, it messes with the whole system.) Once you've worked at Papa John's for a while, you'll learn how to do dough, which is harder, but you won't be expected to do dough during a rush until much later.Before you apply, keep in mind there areÂ -Â more...",0

881,getting deliveries aren't hard. although you have some slow days and times. bonuses aren't really bonuses because the money is usually the same with or with out guarantees but having them is a plus. you get to set your own hours and having multiple deliveries at one time really helps to succeed with minimal movement and time spent,0
1151,It gives you opportunity to work without office but sometimes you miss the coordination and office culture. One thinks of worrk/life balance by working from home but work load and weekly work metrics do not allow it. Also work done is counted not weighed which becomes a problem.,1
480,"Was their for a very long time and if you were a knowledgeable & reliable person it was yours for the taking if you enjoyed your job. Got away with a lot because for the most part majority of workers there were lazy, uneducated and selfish people. But the other people, great people to know and supervisors knew who their good workers were, and knew who their capable, smart workers were. It's a shame that management could not deal with the union to get rid of the bad workers. So they closed it. ",1

437,"A typical work day was full of stress the entire day. Management is very good at saying they do not micro-manage, but constant emails (and every one of them was a priority over the previous one) and incessant interruptions made for a very bad day EVERY day. I learned that United HealthGroup view their employees as a number, not as human beings, and that numbered employee was easily replaceable. Management are robots, working inside boxes, all thinking inside the boxes. The hardest part of the job was seeing quality take back seat to production, knowing claims would be better off going out the door correct, instead of rushing to meet production standards that are set too high, causing unnecessary mistakes and errors. The most enjoyable part of the job was being a remote/telecommuter at home and some of the most wonderful coworkers on my team, minus the supervisors.",0

Then Shipt just cut me off even though I was on the schedule for 84 hrs a week - no offers were given and all shops had to be taken out of Metro that were in cities 90 miles away. A few of the customers were very unreasonable in their ratings; which as a sub-contractor you are not allowed to address- that lowered my Stats. Chat support and Shopper Success were helpful at times and just as unfair at other times especially when asking for late forgiveness (due to Orlando traffic or customer add-ons. I usually received wonderful feedback from my customers. But Shipt deactivated my account and many others without notification, explanation or reason.

There is too much red tape and internal politics that slow any process to a grinding halt so if you are expecting to work with some cadence, think again. Expect meetings on top of more meetings and constant reminders from management and HR for simple every day things like signing your time card to changing their stance of work flexibility to required nonsense courses and other things that pull you away from the core focus of your work. Itâs like a workplace for dummies and management has absolutely no clue about how to inspire or motivate their staff let alone how to tap into their potential. They think they know better but lack the skill set or ability to do so. Many managers here are very insecure and as a result intimidate rather than inspire.Bringing anything that is new or current into the fold is ignored as the good olâ boy network will get together and find a way to turn things around to make it look like it was their idea or that itâs bad and all your fault.If your looking to stay on the cutting edge, look elsewhere as company management seems almost completely ignorant to change or improvement.

This can include: sub bar, hot foods, fresh cuts, etc. We almost maintain most of the aisle in front of us, such as the pasta salads, pudding, etc. We also switch out a lot for cleaning the dishes and slicers.What I learned:This is a tough-ish job. You're on your feet the whole time, helping customers, making prepackaged items, etc. Something I found out when working is that my feet are KILLED after and sometimes during work. Working with customers isn't that tough because, at least at my store, almost all of the customers are sweet and pleasant which makes the more challenging customers easy to manage.Management:For the most part: fantastic. They are all very helpful and nice. That being said: some of the managers are rarely seen (paperwork I assume) and when they are they aren't the most willing to help out with a load of customers. However, that is only one or two managers I have found, and most of them are willing to help deal with the rush.Workplace culture:Not much to say other than fantastic. Very inclusive and pleasant.

Managers with experience, knowledge of the job market and demographic of their area, and proven skills to grow the company were let go and a new, younger group of ""managers and leaders"" were brought in to replace them. The new ""leaders"" had little to no understanding of the job, and were relying on the employees to run things. It was explained to them how the operations were handled and proven successful for years, but they still decided they knew better and completely changed the way the company operated. People not from the area with no knowledge of the job market, and no willingness to study the data, made decisions that negatively affected the company and their employees; both internal and contracted. The more pushback from the ones who knew this would negatively affect the company, the more changes (firings/repremands) were made. Morale was at an all time low.

However at Quicken Loans you can truly bust your butt and earn a life changing amount of money within your first year. If you can pass the licensing exam and stick it out for the first few months of banking the rewards that follow seem truly endless. After my first 12 calendar months at the company (with the first 4 months not writing loans) I have cleared close to $200,000. With the opportunity to earn such an incredible living, the job does require dedication, flexibility, humility, and the willingness to do what is needed or to go the extra mile to get the job done. The common sleight against the company would be the hours. I typically work about +/- 60 hours a week in addition to clients frequently calling and texting my cell phone while off the clock. This sacrifice is very easy to justify once you start to see success, which can come very fast. I would highly recommend any friends or family to interview at QL. Whether it is for a position in banking, or the thousands of support positions between the family of companies, the opportunity for growth and change is limitless.

206,"This is a pretty enjoyable job, shopping for customers and making up your own schedule. The downsides are that you get paid very poorly per shop ($7-9) for a delivery 5 mins away and ($11-13) for deliveries that are 15-20 minutes away. When you factor in driving yo the store, shopping, driving to the delivery location and then back home/to the store it just really isn't worth it. Tips are what can make you successful. Some people tip well and some people don't. Another negative is that you are offered shops based on ratings that you rely on the customer for. Some customers rate you poorly if the store didn't have their item and some will rate you 4/5 just because they feel like that's good and 5/5 is above and beyond. ",0

The trainers and mangers are absolutely great though! Job aids arenât always helpful especially when you have someone waiting on the phone and your taking forever to look through them trying to figure out what to do. Definitely something wrong with their phone system. I got calls all day that were accidentally routed to my department and I had to transfer them to the correct department when half the time they were already transferred multiple times to the wrong department before getting to me.

The job is very busy and fast paced which was nice to keep you busy and make the days go by faster.

Additionally writing knowledge base articles, planning customer contacts in calendar and providing training materials and answering other questions on skype which I managed to do on a daily basis for over 2 years. Also no other shifts are possible so I worked always with no change from 3 AM EDT to 12 PM EDT. The most enjoyable part for me is to help the customers, that was the main reason I was hired to provide support for clients, to be a support agent. For me it is fun to schedule customer contacts in calendars, take phone calls and to call, contact the customer. Primarely to help them and to listen to there issues. Traning and knowledge base articles should be created by content writers and trainers coaches, not from my end. The managemt could prioritize and assign some specific roles and duties to particular agents. This would have increased the work effectivness and better planning.",0

Management used to work together and as a team like all should but not it's every man for himself/herself.

296,"The Good: There is an opportunity to have an impact day one. New hires are expected to contribute immediately and aren't saddled with busy work. Design teams are collaborative and involve a large amount of hands on testing. As a new-hire, there are opportunities to rotate through different teams to build out your exposure and experience. Exposure and training on various tools is also a perk.The Bad: Management decisions regarding the company's core objectives is often reactive to stock market fluctuations. Very little contingency is factored into the business' operating plan. In a market downturn, expect to see a re-org, reductions in force, and/or forced retirements. If you are lucky enough to keep your job, expect changes in your designated project or role within the company. In addition to this, the re-orgs at times are so frequent (every 4-6 months) that you often never finish a project completely. This leaves many employees in a situation where their new supervisor has no visibility to their past work contributions. As a result, the clock is reset on your track to a promotion. Combine this with the seemingly consistent freeze on merit increases, and you have the recipe for bad morale and high turn-over. I have only stayed around this long (10+ years) because I enjoy the people I work with and the product. Unfortunately, more and more of those familiar faces are leaving due the management and HR decisions.Overall a good company to get started at and build experience but lacking in a clear path for career advancement.",0

They simply do not care about the sales specialist but can hire two part timers for cheap to make up a decent sales specialist so they donât have to pay. Very high turn over rate, no raises and you get written up over stupid stuff (example sales score card not meeting requirement) that now gets put against you. Also you have to watch what you say too much gossip. This place gives you a stable job but itâs not a career that will make you happy and want to come to work. ",1

89,"When I was hired over 5 years ago I was proud to work for Kindercare. I felt supported and felt like I was able to provide quality care in a nurturing environment. The director at time was amazing, when I was hired Kindercare provided thorough training that got you excited to be a part of the company. Those types of trainings are no longer provided, leaving new hires to hope they are provided a good teacher to work under. When the director I was hired under left, everything soon went downhill. Management no longer supported their staff. It became more like mean girls in high school. They would sit up front and just talk negatively about other staff and children,, it broke my heart. Staff was extremely over worked, it was hard to even get a bathroom break. Kids were put wherever they had to so ratios worked for them, not what was best for the child. The center was dirty, staff was so tired and overwhelmed that cleaning was no longer a priority. I no longer felt like I could provide the quality, educational, nurturing care I promised the parents, and the children they would receive daily. I was embarrassed to work there, I would often go on my lunch break and cry in my car....yes it was that bad. There was no point in talking to the regional director, the new one came from a previous marketing career, she had no clue about child care or what was best for the children/families or the staff, everyone was a number.

They should have saved the time talking about the benefits we had no access to, and focused on the actual training itself. The project I was hired for seemed ok at first. However the actual people training you to do the job are in the Philippines. Communication was very choppy due to their heavy accents and constant computer problems. There isn't any hands on training, which made navigating the systems extremely confusing. Training was only 7 days, but with as many computer issues we had it was more like 4 days. Then when it was time to take calls we only had chat support mostly with people in the Philippines. Everyone local is too busy to help. When I tried to reach out to my supervisor directly he would just say you gotta take calls, which yes I do, but with no clarification on what's needed it was impossible to help the customers. They would refer me to the knowledge base and tell me to read. Fine, anyone can read, but when the knowledge base doesn't have the answers to the problems I need to get clarification from somewhere, right?

The opportunities for advancement are fantastic, pretty much all of the managers start as crew members and staff are able to earn their Bachelor's degree while working there. The managers at my store understood ethical management practices and actually abided by them (which isn't as common as you'd think) and make a point to do a wellness check with every employee at clock in to make sure they're healthy and won't get anyone sick, even before COVID. I'd go back again in a heartbeat. There are always gonna be some parts of a food service job that suck (being elbows deep in adobo chicken just isn't cute no matter how good the managers are), but my managers were always willing to hear us out and see if there were ways we could make the job easier or more enjoyable.

137,"From the local or plant level, I have no complaints and would easily give a 5 start rating if only commenting from that perspective. What really drives down the moral though is when you're managed from the corporate level. These senior leader from corporate are completely disconnected from reality, no better way to state it. ",0

714,The company hasnât given raises for our team in 6 years. We are underpaid as security analysts. They âpromoteâ you to more responsibility with no pay increase because they hired a new manager and pushed pay scales down. Daily we deal with the same non sense that is not useful to our clients. We canât do our jobs properly due to process restrictions and the philosophy to send every alert.,1

303,"Since 2015 Shipt has had a fair and transparent pay model for its shoppers. 7.5% of the total + $5.00 for each order you shop. Hiring was selective because customer service and the ability to go above and beyond and ""bring the magic"" was a priority. Shopper support at HQ was quick and effective. We felt like we were valued and supported. When the lockdown quarantine hit and requests for orders skyrocketed, Shipt was quick to onboard tens of thousands of new shoppers to meet the demand. There was no training, and it seemed they hired anyone. In July 2020 the company launched a new pay model for shoppers. The pay is now based on an algorithm that according to Shipt ""can't be shared"". Now pay is ""based on effort"" and each order is promised a pay ""range"" that is significantly below the previous transparent and stated pay model. The shopper support that used to be fabulous is now reduced to canned answers as if we were chatting/texting/emailing with a bot. Many veteran shoppers are leaving the company.",0

57,Really enjoyed the work. Just not enough work for everyone. Workers are given a more opportunity to make more money then others because of type of truck and size they are constantly getting.,0
1053,"This CAN be a wonderful place to work. The pay is good and the workload is well paced for your standard in the door positions. Specialized roles are a little more intrusive. The people are a mixed bag. Clique culture is real. If you mind your p's and q's, you'd usually be fine. Management is also a mixed bag, sometimes not as knowledgeable as one would hope, and upper management doesn't have your best interest in mind most times. This is not a union location, so when they want you to work, you will. Sometime you will feel trapped. We will be overstaffed and forced to stay, or understaffed and forced to run. Either is fine for them. 1st shift does no wrong, apparently. Usually blame falls on 2nd and 3rd, or the whole department. Usually gets swept under the rug after a while if they are at fault. Our opinions don't really get voiced often, and ideas aren't taken at face value, but usually get implemented in the background under a different guise. If you navigate properly, working here can be good, or at least manageable. That's without speaking on the diversity issues in play.",0

619,"People complain too much. The job is a bit demanding on the physical side but mentally it's not stressing at all. You work with minimal supervision as long as you do what you are supposed to be doing. Be on time and do what you are supposed to do and you will be fine. If you are used to easy laid back jobs you will think it's difficult but if you are like me, used to very difficult jobs, this is easy. I'm still too new to think about moving up (still temporary until Feb 23) but I like the idea of doing as much as I can and having bigger numbers of scanning, boxes moved, etc. Co workers are nice, managers are nice. I just wish there were more hours available to make it my main full time position but amazon keeps growing so that time may come soon. The break rooms are near the station. Some people think the place is hot, I think it's perfect. I was a bit sore the first 3 days or so but I got used to it and my body needed the workout anyway since Im overweight atm (that's another thing. Good job if you want to lose a few).

If there was, the lake would have to wait, and my family all stressed out, too, for as long as the jobs were coming...So duality: longing for more jobs in general, but panicking if I have something more to do (such as the loved ones).",1

238,"I work Iï¸n the UM Management Dept as a Precertifications Specialist in CA. Itâs a very very very busy and fast paced work environment. Your work day consists of being on the phones from the time you clock in til the time you clock out. This job can be really stressful and mentally exhausting. What makes it even more frustrating is they score 5 of the phone calls you made in a month and rate it on a points system. Youâre pretty much failing if you score less than 96 points, which in turn counts toward how much of a raise you will receive at the end of the year. You get dinged on pretty much EVERYTHING. Iï¸t gets pretty tiring and disappointing when you know you have excellent customer service skills but forget to say this or ask the caller that or you forgot to check that box before documenting. If thereâs one thing Iï¸?could change, it would be auditing our calls and rating it on a points system. Iâd rather just have them tell us what we could have done better when handling a call like that. Aside from the stressors of the job itself, Iï¸?enjoy working with my coworkers and the people who are on the same team as me. Everyone gets along. My supervisor is awesome. Heâs really understanding and definitely looks out for our best interest. Heâs definitely someone Iï¸?can reach out to for any questions or concerns Iï¸?may have.

It's much easier to be ""homegrown"" at Facebook and work your way up to digest the culture, rather than coming in totally new. Former interns or those who started at the bottom and transferred internally seem to do really well (understanding and thriving in FB culture is key here).

It can be hard to get a point across if a job isn't right for you. I was stuck doing the same job for so long i developed a skin condition, hurt my back, and developed foot problems. Management has been a revolving door so at least half the time the asylum is run by the inmates. But if you're in a certain group of people, this stuff doesn't happen. Stand around and talk for 45 mins after break? No problem. In fact the supervisor will join you. (Because what could he possibly have to do?)

If you are unlucky you might get put on a shift where you lose both your Friday and Saturday nights and Sunday mornings. They also run three shifts still but the afternoon shifts overlap 3.5 hours into midnight shift, so either 3rd shift sits for hours or afternoon shift looses a test site.

With everything going on it can get pretty tiring and stressful dealing with the customers bad attitudes. Maybe if the pay was better but all of that for $9.50 is not worth it to me. But you do receive better benefits than other jobs and paid breaks so that's a plus.,0

1035, Management and HR are corrupt. You go speak out on any given issue and they use that against you. They have favoritism for friends and relatives. Thereâs no workplace culture here. You have people that are not really in charge bossing people around because theyâre close to supervisor/hr members. Supervisors are incompetent and barely know anything about leading. You also have management coming in late and leaving early. Supervisor/leads donât wear masks when upper management is not there. You are also going to find leads that like to start drama and spend the whole shift talking about other employees/temps rather than working. Management take it on people who stick up to unfairness while reward people that barely work simply because theyâre âfriendsâ. Itâs like a high school all over again. You are expected to make high numbers on machines youâve never worked in and never been trained on. I would not recommend this job to friends or relatives. ,1

466,"Where to begin? First of all everything that was In the job description was very very misleading. The Only thing they didnât lie about was the pay. You are working 11-13 hour shifts, youâll be lucky to be done before 7:00PM. They only care about numbers not you as a person. You have no life due to the fact you are working Monday-Friday 6:30AM-7:00PM and sometimes Saturdays if you have to take a day off during the week and if there are any rain days. They said it was âeasyâ and âfastâ if you stay on track which is a lie and impossible. They give you 24-27houses and half of them take over 30 minutes to do. If you are on a break they will call and harass you about taking a break. Itâs NOT a 9-5 job. You get walked over and talked to like you are a number. Training isnât really training. Management isnât really involved with how you are trained and nor do they check in. Half of the lawns you do are not informed on when you are coming, it is your job to text/call the customers if you have them on your route which is ridiculous. Most labor jobs that are working 11+ hours have a pay starting off at $15.00. We are worked like slaves so definitely underpaid. ",1

They lack providing training and he/she is a hypocrite. Likes to put you under the bus if the assignment fails, enjoy criticizing every detail about the assignment, and talk down to you in front of management meetings. Since, they do not give raises. My suggestion is to negotiate for a good salary if you are planning to invest in the company for a long time. This company should evaluate their managers, TOP reasons for high turn over. It is not the staff, it is management. Otherwise, they will continue to be a horrible place to work for and it is probably why the company was sold multiple times, from EDS to HP to DXC and now to Gainwell.

435,I have worked at IP for over 5 years. They have a great inclusive culture that is currently focusing on the right things. The pay and benefits are also very competitive.,1
1158,Not a bad place to work as far as atmosphere goes but it feels like working for a pyramid scheme. You have a management that's pushing you to produce sales numbers (no commission here). They tell you that this will allow you to get to where they are but that never happens. The pay is ok if you are living with your parents and your schedule changes constantly without notice. ,0

398,"The employees I worked with were very helpful and willing to to shed their knowledge and learn more about the position they were in as well, however for management, this was a completely different story. Management showed no effort to help their employees during times of adversity. ""Do this"" Do that"" as opposed to ""Let me teach you this so you know how to handle this for next time"". None of that whatsoever. A large part of the department were recent college grads, so behavior like this could be potentially scarring for their carer. Aside from this, there were lots of opportunities for knowledge betterment available, but little promotional opportunities. We felt as if we were running a hamster wheel.",0

745,"Been working at asurion for about 1 year and 3 months. First year everything was going well, the only thing I was worried was about the customers calling in upset about refurbished phones we sent out and high deductibles. October 2020 was when everything went downhill. They started incorporating sales. The pressure, stress that this has brought is not worth the $10 we get for every sale we make. We have to offer on EVERY single call and prior to that we had to make sure we kept our calls below 6 min and 30 secs. Now they expect us to be on every call for at least 20 mins explaining the benefits of asurion home plus. They expect us to be experts in selling a product the trainers barely even knew anything about. We got a couple hours of training for this product. Every single one of my coworkers was told something different about this product I donât even know what to believe anymore. The company itself itâs awesome I loved this company because itâs very diverse and inclusive. One main reason I applied to this job was because I didnât have to sell anything but now if we bring it up to our supervisors we âappliedâ for this position and thereâs nothing that can be done. If you donât meet the 2 sales per week and the sales metrics you could get fired..my biggest issues was them putting the pressure of sales when we already have to worry bout helping customer over policies we donât have any way of changing. I always tried my best to help out a customer but asurion and the management does not care about that.. ",1

I had a really good experience at PetSmart, but I never really got the chance to advance my career there. ",1

828,"Typical day was coming in, pickup up from each shift and just finishing the shift doing typical food service restaurant duties. Decent job but the company is an employee mill and people come and go alot. Students employed typically don't care and management can be hard to contact/non-existent. Depends on the manager. Pay raises are small and it can be hard to manage people that don't really care about the job anyway, but it's easy work. ",0

They treat the temps poorly and everything is based on seniority as far as over time or anything else that is beneficial to the job bonus checks etc.. most of the temps been there for years just to get hired on and the temps get treated bad by workers and management regardless of how hard you work. The company wants you to learn a job that there seniority workers and full time workers know for years in as little as two hours and if u mess up u get the blame and they will find a way to let you go. Enter at your own risk. Itâs not what people make it seem to be and I heard the company was much better back in the day before a lot was changed. Most things was changed to be hard mostly on the new people they hire and easier load on seniorityâs. Also they messes up on people pay checks and anything go wrong in the plant around where they place you at regardless of what they look to blame the new people. Even if a seniority person say something even tho if itâs his fault the management will over ride it all to believe that person over the temp .,1

902,This is a sales job. You can make a lot of money if you are good at sales and working with people. It is hard to get started though. Keeping a second job for a year or two may be a good idea to supplement income. ,0
401,I was a team member selling under two successful agents in Iowa. Literally the only bad thing I have to say is the pay. Very slow start but will pay better once you get your network stronger and such...which is typical for any sales job but you just gotta be able to take a pay cut for a couple months.,0
407,"OverallMy experience working at Humana was truly awful, There is no potential for advancement, frequent layoffs, management will lie to your face, and nothing they do makes any sense. Lots of busy work that does absolutely nothing to help the customers. Working in my next job and having to deal with insurance, I can tell you that Humana was the worst of the worst. They deny every claim without reason, just to see if the customer will appeal the decision. Theyâre a shameless, evil company.",1

1096,"If your a student they work around your schedule. If your not then you work around the students schedule. As far as getting any hours they hire so many students that if somthing is going on, say like a football game everyone calls out. And the rest of the staff has to make up for it. It's also a numbers thing they only give 300 hours aweek for 20 employees. So then it becomes a favoritism schedule. ",0
1121,"Great corporate culture, very conducive to work and self development.Senior management ensures that resources are always available for success of planned initiative.Along with full time manpower, resourced staff from a few chosen vendors are well qualified and provide needed support for completion of the projects.",1
316,The company is so inviting during the recruiting process and during training they tell you youâre only working so much to learn everything. Months go by and youâre still working 65-75 hours. They say weâre supposed to have every other weekend off but thatâs not the case we work 15 hours Mon-Fri and every weekend. No work life balance.,1
742,they are snakes in the grass. They tell you one thing but they so the opposite. They get in to you about safety hard but when it comes to personal life that doesnt matter to them at all.,1
0,"When I first got a job at Kindercare I was very excited. Even after it was obvious that everything I was told was a lie regarding my position and hours, I hung in there waiting for improvements. Unfortunately, all I've learned as time went on is just how petty the staff is especially the management. The favoritism is blatant and the gossip/ rumors are perpetuated by the Directors probably more than anyone else. The Directors will turn a blind eye to child abuse despite us being mandated reporters because they're more worried about the family disenrolling. You will be made to feel like you did the wrong thing if you do report a family to DCFS. No one at Kindercare will stand behind you unless you're part of their inner circle and you can't do anything about mistreatment by Directors because they're all friends with the higher ups in the company. It's just one big circle of petty, entitled, hateful women scratching each others backs and making sure it's you that gets the ax and not any of them! Don't make the mistake of thinking this only happens at one center or in one city cuz it's the entire company!! ",1
87,"As an FA, This is a very difficult career to start out in, and you should be prepared to work very hard and long hours in the first couple of years.

Once established, the work life balance is tremendous, and Edward Jones provides all the tools necessary to build a very successful and financially prosperous career.",1

608,"Unless youâre planning to move up to a management position, I donât recommend working at Loweâs long term. Itâs a good in between job for those unsure about their career path, those wanting to work part time while in school, or those who are retired but still want to work somewhere that isnât too stressful. Not to mention everybody is easy to get along with for the most part.",0

338,Please do not apply for a position with Garda. You will regret working for them. This company will not care about you. You're better off soliciting for money at a Walmart parking lot.,1

1014,Management isn't that great. Pay is decent though. They have short breaks. Not much room for advancement. Very rare for a raise. Not worth a long term career,0
780,I really do like my job. I have always wanted to work for this company. The pace in the factory is very high skilled. You learn a lot from working on multiple lines that are not the same and running different products,1

812,I loved working there but unfortunately I was a temp and my contact ended I would like to have gotten a permanent position I will apply again for the opportunity,1
509,"The only upside of the job was actually helping out the customers. The rest was filled with ""high school drama."" Employees talking about each other behind their backs, gossiping, etc. If people would have spent half the time actually doing work instead of trash talking everybody else it might it have been a decent place. The few that actually did work eventually wised up and left not wanting to deal with the drama. You were either in the ""clique"" or you weren't. We were also understaffed almost the entire time I was there. I've watched multiple people get passed over on a promotion even if they had seniority and more qualified than other people. ",1
297,The job they put me on was ok. It gave me a chance to push forward and move up on the job site. They company had some issues with time sheets or what not but got things fixed right away,0

255,"DHS is a very broad agency to discuss. Some departments of the agency are clearly enforcement in nature, others clearly academic, sill others border on humanitarian. In all, itâs best to want to follow directives, understand the need for thoroughness, sometimes in the form of much red tape, and have a true desire to be of service and be driven by nothing more than the mission. With this, you will be successful, challenged, and enriched.",1
732,"Not true , they start you off as a temp @ 14 bucks. 7p-7a. What a waste of time and only 12 hour shifts working midnights forever.

290,The culture is great and the company is guided by belief principles. Pay is alright for the location but most people are still underpaid. Not a whole lot of work-life balance is going on though. Shadowing is common across the family of companies.,0
286,"Overall as an opener or closer, coming into work was always a fun part of my day, seeing the regulars and checking on my coworkers after their long days. I was taught how to make drinks, heat food and handle cash and order taking at the same time. My mangers were well understanding and very helpful with scheduling and extra hands on deck. Iâd say the hardest part would be the crowding in our working area during our busiest hours, constant bumping into eachother or drinks spilling or handed out wrong. For the easiest I think Iâd have to say it was ability to feel at home and safe with all the changing people. ",0
947,The company has a set list of guidelines that it requires for each different assignment. These must met before you can be assigned a job. The job assignment sometimes is quite difficult and there may be times that it is easy to go over the time given for the task.,0

This facility is part of the protein division - considered food grade. There was so much to learn. Cargill itself offers much to the employee. They show concern about the employee work life balance and daily work ergonomics. ",1
1162,I can say this place is a great company to drive for. Many internal positions and transferring around to find your right fit was easy and painless. I've driven 2 accounts and managed one with jbhunt. Only reason I'd leave is for more income as my only gripe is the driver pay is not top mark. Certainly not the lowest but still.,0

136,Great place to work overall. Management understood workers' needs but couldn't provide sufficient assurances relative to job security and advancement. We experienced the constant threat of being fired despite the high degree of conscientiousness and dedication to work demonstrated.,0
