789,Not worth even going for an interview. Training process was ok but no help when it comes to actually doing the job. Supervisors are unsupportive and always rude. The first day of ânestingâ (when you start taking calls with a supervisor in a chat room to help) was so bad I think we lost 10 people. Didnât show back up for day 2. Donât waste your time. ,2
534,"I stand all day long. Staring at the road and people walking by. Only a 1/2 hour lunch. According to other guards I have spoken to, and who have been there a long time, there is no moving up in the company unless you are a complete sycophant. Also according to those guards, you will not get time off as they have some bogus review every 6 months to earn a week off, and which they will not pass the majority of the guards. At the same time, incompetent people thrive at G4S while the ones with the skills will soon leave. Their training once out in the field is non-existent unless you find another guard to show you. The supervisors just like to read off of the Standard Operating Guides and count that as training. ",2
1120,Very supportive and fun environment. Flexible schedule for those in school. Offers benefits unlike many restaurants. Management typically is promoted from within so has a great understanding of employees responsibilities. ,1

762,I just had my baby and was given a 4pm-1am shift. Couldn't get a trade and they didn't care. This place is all about links. The drivers are awful. They only care about you coming to work and not how you will get home.,2
202,Ethics lacking. Less so they can prosper more. Very cheap company. Seem to care only for people who work hard and are willing to give up extra time. Budgets are low and make it a miserable environment. Management is unprofessional. ,2
931,"What i enjoyed about PayPal was learning the laws of debt collection. What was exciting to me was reading PayPal users agreements and the various different sections regarding fair debt collection, customer verification procedures, federal trade Commission rules and rregulations,",1
316,The company is so inviting during the recruiting process and during training they tell you youâre only working so much to learn everything. Months go by and youâre still working 65-75 hours. They say weâre supposed to have every other weekend off but thatâs not the case we work 15 hours Mon-Fri and every weekend. No work life balance.,2
379,"Great place to work. They are very flexible with working with you especially if youâre a parent. The pay is great, the managers are friendly however depending on who you are teamed with. Majority of them are fine to work with. The end of the tax season bonus is phenomenal ",1
663,I really do like my job. I have always wanted to work for this company. The pace in the factory is very high skilled. You learn a lot from working on multiple lines that are not the same and running different products,1

1099,"Working with Volt was somewhat disappointing at the end. They would not extend my contract to March because I had to many points against me. This is something I didn't plan on happening.

The promise a job as a maintenance technician and you will actually be a glorified production technician, you will load parts, you will stand on concrete 12 hours a night. You will not at any point do anything close to maintenance other than pushing buttons or drive a robot to a point, management does not care about you, you are 100% a number and nothing more.

Otherwise YOU WILL NEVER GET PROMOTED. we have a stocker who routinely works triple what the stocking team does ( four other people) put together and instead of recognizing the hard work he's done over the years they promote a manager's buddy.

195,I currently work here itâs not bad I just hate that Iâm timed in the register and we get hours based on how good we are.You basically have to be fast in the floor and in the register mostly when the main managers are there or they will really stress you out about going faster which will make you have anxiety.,2

479,This job was very overwhelming. I was thrown into the waters very early on in my training. The work-life balance is TERRIBLE and the benefits suck!!!!,2
1074,Management always preaches that they value life work balance but requires you to work 26 days straight to get 2 days off most of the time even when there is no work. Most everything the managers say only pertains to them and not the floor workers. ,2
308,Unhealthy and toxic. The end. Poor management and high turnover in that department. Didnât value a smart innovator. They only value brown nosers and drama.,2
108,Best management I've ever had and everyone is there to help each other succeed! There are so many opportunities to move up and so many people to help you achieve your goals. It can be challenging but it keeps the job interesting!,1
854,Love the management from the top down. Truly care about succeeding and helping each other grow. Teammates were always willing to help and teach you/share best practices. ,1
299,You know there is a problem when a company is ALWAYS hiring. Allied Universal is one of those companies that treats there employees so poorly that they can't keep anyone.,2
714,The company hasnât given raises for our team in 6 years. We are underpaid as security analysts. They âpromoteâ you to more responsibility with no pay increase because they hired a new manager and pushed pay scales down. Daily we deal with the same non sense that is not useful to our clients. We canât do our jobs properly due to process restrictions and the philosophy to send every alert.,2
20,I worked at Microsoft for 3.5 years. I learned a lot and left do to other growth opportunities that became available to me. It's a great company to work for.,1
169,Don't accept position without knowing how unstable their work environment is. I quit a solid secure position and when interview ed by senior managers they didn't mention how volatile their work environment was. Once on board I started hearing from senior staff how unsecured their position were and witnessed person getting WFR notices.,2
896,Very rewarding job. I retired from GM with a nice retirement. Excellent job with great benefits. You can excel within the company. Highly recommended.,1
598,I started out on 3rd shift and it was fun at first. When I was hired they reassured us that 3rd shift was there to stay....but because management decided to screw up orders with other contracts and lost them they decided to suddenly do away with 3rd shift and forced us all to second not caring about our living situation and they no time to try and work thing out for those of us with kids and families.,2
887,"I loved my jobs (2 locations) at Compass group. Many opportunities for advancement and excellent on the job training. Great compensation package. The management team was easy to talk to. I made many new contacts and friends I still talk to often. When I was contacted by my former manager, a year after I left, he had a new job offer for me and it was easy to jump right back in. Fantastic place to work!",1
940,"I was hired as a seasonal employee and started at the beginning of November. I went in for my training and watched videos for three hours then went home. I came back Thursday to finish my training and was sent out to the floor. My manager started showing me around but then left and I was stranded out on the floor with no idea what to do! Thankfully another employee kind of showed me around. Then I got to do the register for a bit. That first week I worked 6 hours and the next week 0 hours. Then came Black Friday week and I worked 10. Currently Iâm working about 20ish hours a week which is nice. Overall, I like the job and the people there. The customers have been nice for the most part. My least favorite part of the job is stocking the shelves. I also wasnât trained on how to find stock from the back so if something isnât in the under stock I donât know where to get more to put on the shelves.",1
1022,Not worth the money. they always hire part time. Itâll take you awhile to advance to full time even if you do training. more than half of the people you work with are not efficient. Store manager isnât implementing efficient work or supervising. Puts way to much trust in workers to do their jobs correctly. Always short staffed because itâs mainly 16-19 year olds working in the store super high turnover people just come an go so youâll never have enough help if youâre experienced in tires and work here You WILL be pulling the team whatever shift you work. I could keep going but I got things to do ,2
988,"if you are looking for job security, good people to work with, and great benefits, this job is for you. They take safety very seriously and don't expect you to do a job you not trained on. the only downfall is you won't make a good wage until you invest years into the company.",1
62,Great side husle to do while you find a job/career/ business or get on with what your goals is in life. Extremely Flexible you can do your thing on the side while you're making money with Uber.,1
144,It's a job. Customers show more appreciation than the company. Revenue seems to be the only focus and sales team are ruthless with their sales. Management only seems to be interested making budget and most workers could care less about anything. ,2
5,"This basically was a complete waste of time.Its simply a culture of worn down class b drivers with a major chip on they shoulders towards class a. I just wanted to get home every night. I was overworked,underpaid and the culture here is insane. Be prepared to be a bulk driver making over 70 something stops a day lifting mattresses full of bed bugs,Torn down houses massive piles and people leaving out hundreds of bags full of drywall. In addition the person they place you with putting 90% of the lifting on you! They should be more honest and upfront about the position and equipment.",2

265,Good company with good benifits. I enjoy working with others as a team. I get along with people if I am treated fairly and will always lend a hand to help others.,1
148,"The campaign i was working for had horrible software. Once you were in a particular workflow the software was extremely limited in allowing you to look up customer info so youd have to cancel the whole thing and go look up the info and start all over again. You really cant realize it until you are prematurely forced to take calls. The trainers are very nice and helpful and knowledgeable. They trained the systems and information to properly do the job; but did not allow ANY time doing mock calls while operating the systems. Many system errors were false or unexplained and happened as you think you are done on the call. In a very short time working I had frequent system issues, that their IT had little interest with fixing. The biggest deal breaker, the week before Christmas tell me there will be mandatory over time, of their choosing . I dont want any company to have that much power over my free time.",2
852,Ibex is a decent place to work but not somewhere I would recommend for someone to have their career. The management is dirty and has favorites within the company. ,2
783,A friendly place to work a fast paste role's on hand support everyone makes you feel welcome great managers on going training. Warm loving place to work,1
1184,Training was so ridiculous nothing made sense and trainers and managers make it feel impossible to ask questions or for help. So donât waste your time here like I did. ,2
1058,Pretty good experience to start off in the call center world. Pay is decent and over time is nice. Itâs hard requesting off days and i sometimes feel management isnât really there,1
270,Communication is zero within the company. I started working at teleperformance November 2020 and i have had issues with replacing my equipment its been one issue after another and i am yet to complete training and actually work. I feel like i have wasted my time being there. ,2
810,My short time there was filled with other delivery drivers that would take close good tipping routes and stuck me with the far ones. Also youâre told to help cut and box pizzas however most of the drivers do not. I would not recommend.,2

654,"Management only cares about numbers. They micromanage and will force you to work OT in the 8th hour of your day and they don't care about work/life balance or family obligations. Was just forced to work Friday July 3 'a federal holiday for every other insurance company, but not Aetna'. Management is very disrespectful. There is no communication. Questions go unanswered. Training is Nonexistent. They favor the lazy people who are poor workers but talk a good game. As far as pay goes, I have made more in prior jobs. Took a pay cut to come to this dead end job. There is no room for advancement. Accrued time off has been reduced. Company 401k match has been reduced. Staffing has been reduced. The only thing that has increased is the cost of your health insurance, hours you work, and the work you are expected to do. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. I assure you, you will live to regret it.",2

The opportunity for advancement is great if you are dedicated with a good work ethicAs a CD manager, I spent my days directing my associates to be in the right place at the right time and making sure departments were running appropriately.You must be able to listen with empathy.

757,"There was little to no training. The training you received was irreverent to the job.

No HR help, employees can do whatever they want.",2
869,"My experience has been positive, albeit some organizational hiccups. It's a good opportunity to seize and take advantage of to advance, as the demand for private security is growing. ",1
625,"Alot of job ads say ""uncapped earning potential"" or ""uncapped commission"" to draw folks in but rarely is that relevant for 90% of new hires. However at Quicken Loans you can truly bust your butt and earn a life changing amount of money within your first year. If you can pass the licensing exam and stick it out for the first few months of banking the rewards that follow seem truly endless. After my first 12 calendar months at the company (with the first 4 months not writing loans) I have cleared close to $200,000. With the opportunity to earn such an incredible living, the job does require dedication, flexibility, humility, and the willingness to do what is needed or to go the extra mile to get the job done. The common sleight against the company would be the hours. I typically work about +/- 60 hours a week in addition to clients frequently calling and texting my cell phone while off the clock. This sacrifice is very easy to justify once you start to see success, which can come very fast. I would highly recommend any friends or family to interview at QL. Whether it is for a position in banking, or the thousands of support positions between the family of companies, the opportunity for growth and change is limitless. For the first time in my professional career I can say I have absolute faith in my employer to do right by not only myself but also for each client we interact with. ",1

372,"Folks that play politics advance regardless of results. Culture is one of increasing staff to demonstrate that you have an important role. Focus on efficiency and best use of staff is well down the list. The divisions between corporate and the business lines & between businesses and technology create a culture where for someone to succeed then someone else has to be shown to fail. Loyalty is defined as ""deflecting any criticism of the people who report to me""; not because they are perfect but to prevent any negative perception of the manager. ",2

610,When you first start you hear about so many good things about the company then when you are finally on the floor itâs a whole different ball game out there. They treat the temps poorly and everything is based on seniority as far as over time or anything else that is beneficial to the job bonus checks etc.. most of the temps been there for years just to get hired on and the temps get treated bad by workers and management regardless of how hard you work. The company wants you to learn a job that there seniority workers and full time workers know for years in as little as two hours and if u mess up u get the blame and they will find a way to let you go. Enter at your own risk. Itâs not what people make it seem to be and I heard the company was much better back in the day before a lot was changed. Most things was changed to be hard mostly on the new people they hire and easier load on seniorityâs. Also they messes up on people pay checks and anything go wrong in the plant around where they place you at regardless of what they look to blame the new people. Even if a seniority person say something even tho if itâs his fault the management will over ride it all to believe that person over the temp .,2

925,Culture here is guarded and coworkers seems afraid. Resources are not provided for your success. There is much confusion and poor communication among the ranks. The organization is quick to provide negative feedback in an effort to scare employees into submission. The company does not focus on customer satisfaction nor do they seem to value employee health and welfare. Customers have significant misgivings about their aggressive contracts that go with their products similar to some disliked cell phone companies. I do not recommend working for this company.,2

221,Too many young kids that think its okay to call out every chance they get. Theyâre unproductive and constantly are in the back not helping. The manager does nothing about this toxic environment and the toxic people. There are never upbeat people the staff just don't care about their jobs and complain their whole shift.

1137,"When I started shopping for Shipt in February, I was doing about 8 shops a day, and making over $1,000 a week. Then Shipt just cut me off even though I was on the schedule for 84 hrs a week - no offers were given and all shops had to be taken out of Metro that were in cities 90 miles away. A few of the customers were very unreasonable in their ratings; which as a sub-contractor you are not allowed to address- that lowered my Stats. Chat support and Shopper Success were helpful at times and just as unfair at other times especially when asking for late forgiveness (due to Orlando traffic or customer add-ons. I usually received wonderful feedback from my customers. But Shipt deactivated my account and many others without notification, explanation or reason. They have poor ethics and have tarnished their image as a company.",2
366,"The pay is good, but the work itself is very confusing. I do like that it was a work from home position. They emphasise on all of their great benefits and perks, but we were temporary employees for the first 90 days, so none of those benefits and perks were actually available to us. They should have saved the time talking about the benefits we had no access to, and focused on the actual training itself. The project I was hired for seemed ok at first. However the actual people training you to do the job are in the Philippines. Communication was very choppy due to their heavy accents and constant computer problems. There isn't any hands on training, which made navigating the systems extremely confusing. Training was only 7 days, but with as many computer issues we had it was more like 4 days. Then when it was time to take calls we only had chat support mostly with people in the Philippines. Everyone local is too busy to help. When I tried to reach out to my supervisor directly he would just say you gotta take calls, which yes I do, but with no clarification on what's needed it was impossible to help the customers. They would refer me to the knowledge base and tell me to read. Fine, anyone can read, but when the knowledge base doesn't have the answers to the problems I need to get clarification from somewhere, right? The last straw for me was when my supervisor wasn't responding, so I went into another support chat room, which we were added to the rooms that were visible, and instead of getting help one of the local supervisors barked at me to go back into my supervisors chat supportÂ -Â more...",2

Only way to get ahead is a** kissing (like majorily) sometimes you can show up late and give your boss a gift card to compensate the unprofessional behavior and that gift card is also pathetically accepted. That should tell you a lot of the dept culture. Unrealistic deadlines, LOTS of favoritism, in certain teams - one specific team can not retain any females as the director is a female herself and cannot get along with any females. Reported behavior goes unheard. Stay away.",2
123,"Management at Ferguson look out for themselves, it's all about how they look and what you can do to make them look better. As far as learning, the other associates there will help you, teach you, and guide you in the right direction. This company is archaic and wants you to use technology from 1970 to preform in the 2000's. The definition of insanity is doing something over and over again without change and expecting a different result. Upper management really needs to reevaluate their current management team. Ferguson also wants you to increase business on your own and WILL NOT EVER advertises, huge mistake.",2
134,"Management never on the same page, store manager never at the store. Hrs working are never consistent always short staffed or over staffed. They cut overtime so ASMs and Managers can get raises and bonuses. They simply do not care about the sales specialist but can hire two part timers for cheap to make up a decent sales specialist so they donât have to pay. Very high turn over rate, no raises and you get written up over stupid stuff (example sales score card not meeting requirement) that now gets put against you. Also you have to watch what you say too much gossip. This place gives you a stable job but itâs not a career that will make you happy and want to come to work. ",2

745,"Been working at asurion for about 1 year and 3 months. First year everything was going well, the only thing I was worried was about the customers calling in upset about refurbished phones we sent out and high deductibles. October 2020 was when everything went downhill. They started incorporating sales. The pressure, stress that this has brought is not worth the $10 we get for every sale we make. We have to offer on EVERY single call and prior to that we had to make sure we kept our calls below 6 min and 30 secs. Now they expect us to be on every call for at least 20 mins explaining the benefits of asurion home plus. They expect us to be experts in selling a product the trainers barely even knew anything about. We got a couple hours of training for this product. Every single one of my coworkers was told something different about this product I donât even know what to believe anymore. The company itself itâs awesome I loved this company because itâs very diverse and inclusive. One main reason I applied to this job was because I didnât have to sell anything but now if we bring it up to our supervisors we âappliedâ for this position and thereâs nothing that can be done. If you donât meet the 2 sales per week and the sales metrics you could get fired..my biggest issues was them putting the pressure of sales when we already have to worry bout helping customer over policies we donât have any way of changing. I always tried my best to help out a customer but asurion and the management does not care about that.. ",2

967,"Not a fun or inspiring place to work at. Management is mainly focused on âhuman capitalâ and that should tell you all you need to know about working here. There is too much red tape and internal politics that slow any process to a grinding halt so if you are expecting to work with some cadence, think again. Expect meetings on top of more meetings and constant reminders from management and HR for simple every day things like signing your time card to changing their stance of work flexibility to required nonsense courses and other things that pull you away from the core focus of your work. Itâs like a workplace for dummies and management has absolutely no clue about how to inspire or motivate their staff let alone how to tap into their potential. They think they know better but lack the skill set or ability to do so. Many managers here are very insecure and as a result intimidate rather than inspire.Bringing anything that is new or current into the fold is ignored as the good olâ boy network will get together and find a way to turn things around to make it look like it was their idea or that itâs bad and all your fault.If your looking to stay on the cutting edge, look elsewhere as company management seems almost completely ignorant to change or improvement.

In the beginning they told us it was temporary- but this was back in June. September is almost done and its still a waking nightmare to work here. I just want my old job back, when everything was normal. Its obvious that greedy management is enjoying the extra productivity because they show no signs of rolling back the changes.Before all that, the work/ life balance was horrible. I was willing to put up with it regardless but its 12 hour shifts and you work 14 out of 28 days unless you need the extra hours, which they are always happy to give you(a big plus.) The other shifts routinely leave you a mess meaning you will be stuck with part of their job and all of yours. With the increased workload lately I find it nearly impossible to get all my work done in the amount of time expected- and I am one of the faster workers. I have worked almost every shift without breaks for the last few months and I'm burned out.Being deployed was easier than the abuse I put up with at work.",2

1095,"I have worked here for 2 years. I have contributed an above average amount of work and also led my department in successful improvements to our systems and processes. Since i've started my responsibilities and workload has increased drastically requiring me to sacrifice a lot of personal time and work excessive overtime. My pay has not changed. The management has taken my work and efforts for granted and hardly acknowledged any of my efforts. This situation can be applied to MANY others who share the same view. Once you reach about 2-3yrs with this company most people leave to work somewhere else because of the same sentiment. Because it looks good on their resume they are able to find substantially better jobs elsewhere which is a big benefit, but most people leave because they are underpaid and overworked. You also need to be here at least 3 years before you're able to take ownership of the full amount in your 401k. Otherwise you forfeit a substantial amount of what the company matches at 4%.",2

You are only paid $9.25 an hour and the job is very dangerous and stressful. You work 7 days a week non stop. And they make you work double shifts in all kinds of weather.

466,"Where to begin? First of all everything that was In the job description was very very misleading. The Only thing they didnât lie about was the pay. You are working 11-13 hour shifts, youâll be lucky to be done before 7:00PM. They only care about numbers not you as a person. You have no life due to the fact you are working Monday-Friday 6:30AM-7:00PM and sometimes Saturdays if you have to take a day off during the week and if there are any rain days. They said it was âeasyâ and âfastâ if you stay on track which is a lie and impossible. They give you 24-27houses and half of them take over 30 minutes to do. If you are on a break they will call and harass you about taking a break. Itâs NOT a 9-5 job. You get walked over and talked to like you are a number. Training isnât really training. Management isnât really involved with how you are trained and nor do they check in. Half of the lawns you do are not informed on when you are coming, it is your job to text/call the customers if you have them on your route which is ridiculous. Most labor jobs that are working 11+ hours have a pay starting off at $15.00. We are worked like slaves so definitely underpaid. ",2
69,This company was amazing to me. It was super easy to learn and everyone was really friendly. They didnât mind showing the new person the ropes. The pay was amazing for me and my lifestyle. ,1

407,"OverallMy experience working at Humana was truly awful, There is no potential for advancement, frequent layoffs, management will lie to your face, and nothing they do makes any sense. Lots of busy work that does absolutely nothing to help the customers. Working in my next job and having to deal with insurance, I can tell you that Humana was the worst of the worst. They deny every claim without reason, just to see if the customer will appeal the decision. Theyâre a shameless, evil company.",2

I am sad and upset about it because I had just gotten into a good pace, with my pay each month rising steadily, when I was literaly kicked off the website. For me it was amazing. Due to my mental issues, it is difficult being in an actual work environment, around people, for long periods of time. After you are fired, that is it! you can't reapply, even for other positions,.. and they won't talk to you about why you are let go. you are given one warning if your stats falter and if it happens again,.. well,.. see ya.",2

On the plus side, the culture is the overall pretty flexible meaning if you have to step out for an hour or so, that's perfectly fine.",1

481,"I am still here, because I have a great team. Currently, I am seeking elsewhere to get out of this negative environment. My current manager has poor leadership and communication skills. They lack providing training and he/she is a hypocrite. Likes to put you under the bus if the assignment fails, enjoy criticizing every detail about the assignment, and talk down to you in front of management meetings. Since, they do not give raises. My suggestion is to negotiate for a good salary if you are planning to invest in the company for a long time. This company should evaluate their managers, TOP reasons for high turn over. It is not the staff, it is management. Otherwise, they will continue to be a horrible place to work for and it is probably why the company was sold multiple times, from EDS to HP to DXC and now to Gainwell. This work place don't deserve good working people who can bring in growth. Good working people, this place will only make your resume look poor. ",2

If the financial advisor doesn't ascribe to them, then you will find have to choose between the two.

1035, Management and HR are corrupt. You go speak out on any given issue and they use that against you. They have favoritism for friends and relatives. Thereâs no workplace culture here. You have people that are not really in charge bossing people around because theyâre close to supervisor/hr members. Supervisors are incompetent and barely know anything about leading. You also have management coming in late and leaving early. Supervisor/leads donât wear masks when upper management is not there. You are also going to find leads that like to start drama and spend the whole shift talking about other employees/temps rather than working. Management take it on people who stick up to unfairness while reward people that barely work simply because theyâre âfriendsâ. Itâs like a high school all over again. You are expected to make high numbers on machines youâve never worked in and never been trained on. I would not recommend this job to friends or relatives. ,2

0,"When I first got a job at Kindercare I was very excited. Even after it was obvious that everything I was told was a lie regarding my position and hours, I hung in there waiting for improvements. Unfortunately, all I've learned as time went on is just how petty the staff is especially the management. The favoritism is blatant and the gossip/ rumors are perpetuated by the Directors probably more than anyone else. The Directors will turn a blind eye to child abuse despite us being mandated reporters because they're more worried about the family disenrolling. You will be made to feel like you did the wrong thing if you do report a family to DCFS. No one at Kindercare will stand behind you unless you're part of their inner circle and you can't do anything about mistreatment by Directors because they're all friends with the higher ups in the company. It's just one big circle of petty, entitled, hateful women scratching each others backs and making sure it's you that gets the ax and not any of them! Don't make the mistake of thinking this only happens at one center or in one city cuz it's the entire company!! ",2

Just like any other job, however, the experience will be dependent on your manager. My location went through 3 GMs in the span of 2 weeks which caused much of the staff to leave so closing was consistently getting off around 1am and we were understaffed during shifts. That's just my experience with a single location, so if you're on the fence about applying I would definitely go for it.",1
509,"The only upside of the job was actually helping out the customers. The rest was filled with ""high school drama."" Employees talking about each other behind their backs, gossiping, etc. If people would have spent half the time actually doing work instead of trash talking everybody else it might it have been a decent place. The few that actually did work eventually wised up and left not wanting to deal with the drama. You were either in the ""clique"" or you weren't.

It can be hard to get a point across if a job isn't right for you. I was stuck doing the same job for so long i developed a skin condition, hurt my back, and developed foot problems. Management has been a revolving door so at least half the time the asylum is run by the inmates. But if you're in a certain group of people, this stuff doesn't happen. Stand around and talk for 45 mins after break? No problem. In fact the supervisor will join you. (Because what could he possibly have to do?)

Also seen really great employees passed up for promotions because they weren't in the management's favored people.

851,"I worked at branch D82, the manager is a condescending, belittling, corporate tool who treats everyone as if they were idiots. The maintenance program of this company is laughable at best. They feel they're too important and too good to compete in the market, but talk about the competition like they are vermon. 20 employees came and left in the 4.5 yrs I was there. The pay is pathetic. They want you to cut corners and send equipment out looking like trash and barely functioning. Their only concern is how much fleet is on rent, nothing else. Branch manager brought his personal vehicle in the shop during business hours and had his top mechanic spend over 6 hours replacing the headlight capsules on the clock. pictures were taken and sent to our DM, he didn't care, also sent them to HR, they didn't care either. And UR, please don't respond with your automated fake response about how you're sorry about my experience with your company and this type of thing is not reflective of your business and values, because it most certainly is.",2

It's hard for me to speak like this because I practically grew up there and have many fond memories but about 3 years ago when management changed throughout the district the environment declined drastically. Management used to work together and as a team like all should but not it's every man for himself/herself. There certainly are obvious favorites in staff and management which means different rules for each person. The good ones that work hard and want to grow with the company get forgotten about if they aren't in certain clicks.

At this company I worked for 2 different IBO's and they both got away with not paying me for half of a month which put me out over $1500 and Arise said they paid the IBO, and it would be up to me to go after the IBO.

They claim to be transparent and they claim to have integrity, and yet during this pandemic with a confirmed case of c19 in their building best they could do is say wash your hands and move some desks apart. Not so much as a warning to employees (some of which have children at home, others have elderly parents they take care of, and even some actual seniors who work in the building so many lives at risk due to their intentional negligence) or sick time and barely a work from home option. I left before all of this started because i could see the direction the company was moving but my wife (who has severe asthma and therefor is a high risk case) stayed and just got FIRED because she didn't come in and risk her life for their lousy wage.

My manager was kind and always willing to train us on new tasks so that we could all work together as a team to support each other. The opportunities for advancement are fantastic, pretty much all of the managers start as crew members and staff are able to earn their Bachelor's degree while working there. The managers at my store understood ethical management practices and actually abided by them (which isn't as common as you'd think) and make a point to do a wellness check with every employee at clock in to make sure they're healthy and won't get anyone sick, even before COVID. I'd go back again in a heartbeat. There are always gonna be some parts of a food service job that suck (being elbows deep in adobo chicken just isn't cute no matter how good the managers are), but my managers were always willing to hear us out and see if there were ways we could make the job easier or more enjoyable. They also didn't allow customers to abuse employees and stepped in when people got out of hand, which I've never had even at an office job before.

Now I DO NOT.Like the other reviewers, the company DOES NOT CARE about its collaborators, they only care about the metrics.First thing, someone had a very bright idea that it would be good to place a hard goal of achieving 35 in a CCAT early in the hiring process. If you don't get the 35, the hiring process ends and you are banned from reapplying to the position for 6 months.If you pass the initial trials and tribulations, you go to the interview and get an offer. After that you enter in what they call a remote university, sort of an induction into their ""work culture"".But before you even start the remoteu, you have to take ANOTHER ccat and YOU HAVE TO score 35 AGAIN, else you will be terminated and whatever time you invested WILL NOT BE PAYED.If you make it past, then you start the training that will last 4 weeks(payed). They use Payoneer as their pay company.Once you finish the training, you will be assigned to a team and the world of pain will begin.You will be constantly HARRASSED by the Quality team, which will practically breathe down your neck reviewing EVERYTHING you do, and if it doesnt meet their absurd criteria, it will be flagged as failure and your metrics will be affected.I.E, if you pick a ticket and you send a reply to the customer, the QA team will review the reply before is actually send to the customer.

Employees are routinely left out of conversations that affect their jobs. Senior leadership is insistent on fostering a ""resilient"" staff without providing the resources necessary - honesty, accountability, robust benefits to name a few. Workloads are all over the place. Some salaried employees are expected to work regular business hours and put in an additional 10-20 hours/week. An employee was publicly shouted down by their supervisor for pointing out they were being overworked. Leadership protects bullies. Employees outside of KC HQ are left without the resources and support they need to do their job. VPs in External Affairs are out of touch with the staff reporting to them. Pay rationale is opaque and salary ranges are inconsistent. Financial issues are cited as a reason for pay stagnation and low wages, while senior leadership makes hundreds of thousands of dollars.

196,"The work was interesting when i could find some, but, they give you materials to read before starting that offer some explanation of the work but not everything. They only give you two chances before randomly firing you by email with very little warning. Your work is peer reviewed, which is a horrible idea, as the people reviewing your work are also vying for the same work you are trying to do, so its easy to give someone a horrible review to get them out of the way and make more work available. Management needs to take it easy on people, better explain the job, have peer reviewers that give constructive criticism, but that also aren't trying to do the same work as you. ",2

1018,I first worked for this company coming out of High School. I always worked hard had a good attitude and was always ready to learn. I would always be to work on time and ready. I always came into work early for overtime and stayed for overtime work when needed. The management team at the lowville Kraft Heinz Plant will take advantage of thier temp workers and never hire them on regardless of how much work they put into work,2
1003,Loved working for the DOD. There was never a dull moment. The only reason I had to leave is because after COVID the hours was decreased because of restrictions within the field I worked in. And I exhausted my leave and could not afford to pay my bills with what I would be bringing home.,1
535,Management was not fair to all individuals. Some employees got more free time then others. Management was strict about staying on the phone. I did not like monthly reviews. The feedback was not always accurate.,2

1050,"The pay is not worth the constant stress. The HR department is a joke. Management is as well. For the lack of a better term to many Indians and not enough chiefs. No one knew what the other one was doing, unless it was wrong then you were written up for something that management didn't tell you, but you were held responsible for it anyway. Team leads play favorites, but that happens every place you work honestly. ",2

1139,"I absolutely loved working for this company. Some days could be pretty stressful, but thatâs the nature of the business. I loved that my coworkers and manager all seemed to get along really well and we helped each other out a lot. I enjoyed my time with this company and truly felt it was a good fit for my schedule, work to home balance etc. the only downside was the pay. If the pay were more fairly matched to the rest of the market, it would have made sense to stay there for many years. You canât supplement hourly pay with commission, if you have no tenure and customers arenât booked for you, which someone will always argue they helped them last, and question why you have âtheir customerâ? even if Itâs been two years since theyâve seen them and ONLY after you put in all the work to sell them work. Donât even bother to try and book yourself appointments, because even if you follow the rules people will get angry that you âstoleâ?their customer, even when the customer specifically requests not to be seen by said person again. You wonât make a lot of money here, but the environment really is pretty chill and mostly respectful/ light hearted. ",1
886,Too much stress for selling sugar water. Upper management is out of touch with reality. Always trying to reinvent the wheel. Front line supervisors are not appreciated as much. Union contracts are horrible. ,2
1146,I don't have too much to say but I can definitely say that the list of things you have to do is amazing. You can also expect to spend an extra 25-40 minutes after shift continuing to clean up isles. Management was helpful but as far as asking other employees for help or knowledge is pretty shakey. Definitely not enough pay for the drama and insane amount of work at the store closing. Also zero tolerance for being early or slightly late. Breaks are very irregular as well. ,2

262,"Working here is typically a thankless unless you are a system engineer or upper manager. Very political atmosphere. Upsetting the wrong person usually ment you were let go.

962,"You can be overworked, and seen as expendable. Difficult to move up depending on the management.

The managers permanently stand around watching you and talk everything possible not related to work (like football and everything else they watched one night before) when they could be helping the employees. Whenever you mess up one little thing you have 5-6 different managers/supervisors/leads/ coming to you and telling you about. Really ??? Oh, wow. Majority of the managers have no management skill. They ignore you when you ask for help and later come back to slam you for not doing your job well enough. I felt insulted all the time and not only me. Listen : do yourself a big favor and DO NOT work here.U-LINE Distribution Center in Braselton, GA has to be one of the worst places a person could work and it's more difficult to get hired than it is to get into Harvard.

99,Does not have the students and teachers best interest at heart classes are too small with too many kids in one class. Management is terrible and disrespectful to staff and children are constantly being moved to classrooms they donât belong in. They do not follow covid guidelines thoroughly . Do not care about teachers needs and lack supplies needed to teach and do not order them when asked. Teachers are not thoroughly trained. They enroll special needs kids but do not have any teachers who specialize in special needs so they are not getting the proper care they need. Your child will literally just be being babysat and will learn nothing ... waist of time and money tuition is too high for your child to be eating on coffee filters ,2

903,Worked here on and off during college. The manager is really friendly and understanding of other things that go on in your life and is willing to work with you (within reason). I just wish the hourly pay was more.,1
514,"The pay is pretty good for the roles, and the system for payment is pretty transparent. And it is truly a fully remote job. But other than that, there's not much good to say.In exchange for the pretty good pay, note that you get no healthcare, no other benefits, no paid time off(although taking unpaid time off within reason seemed pretty easy), no retirement, no maternity/paternity leave, no holidays, certainly no kind of stock benefits or profit sharing, you are financially responsible for all relevant hardware, and you're paid as a contractor...which means if you live in the US and some other places, you'll be paying extra taxes. In addition, for the support position I briefly worked, there are 3 different 9-hour shifts you may be asked to work, you get little say in which one you get, it can change every month, and there are no shift differentials.You also get extremely draconian oversight with webcam and 'productivity' surveillance through a software called WorkSmart, which basically takes pictures of you every 10 minutes at random intervals and tracks how many keystrokes and mouseclicks you've made. They use this data to, among other things, decide if you were unproductive for any given period, and if they come to that conclusion they will dock your pay. If they come to that conclusion too many times, they will terminate you.On top of this, the positions are extremely unstable. Through your training, there are any number of hurdles for which they may terminate you for not passing to their liking. You could be terminated on day one for not passing their cognitiveÂ -Â more...",2

858,Worst management i have ever worked with in my life... if i could give a 0 start review i would. No one knows what theyâre doing in there and training is for only 1 day then they expect you to go out and work on your own with no mistakes. Please do not apply at any capstone job they will do you dirty from day 1 and expect the most from you. I got in a disagreement with the site manager and 20 minutes into work they come up to me claiming i have 30 points and i need to sign these papers which i refused and grabeed the employee handbook and showed them it clearly said after 5 points i am terminated. So next day i come in and get fired. Not worth the stress at all. They also said we would be making $700-$1000 a week which my paychecks were around $200 a week. I wouldnt recommend this job to anybody and if you work there now then you know exactly what i am talking about. They couldn't keep employees for more than a month ,2

120,As a former employee Iâm glad that I donât have to deal with the stress and the pressures that it puts on their employees. Perfection is expected and if you are not you will be counseled and reprimanded. The learning curve is tremendous because you cannot make a mistake once or you will be docked for the case. Unfriendly coworkers and trainers make the already high pressured atmosphere unbearable. that much worse,2

177,"Made me a lead for a site but I donât get paid anything over minimum wage. We donât get covid pay, so you only get 2 days of sick pay and after that your on your own. During the month of December-January we were given 3 weeks off without pay. Hours are also not that great... you work Monday - Friday for an amount of 20hours. Thereâs really no direction and events are dropped onto you last minute. Leads communicate the most with supervisors leaving others to feel unwanted. If we are all getting paid the same then we should all be included. No pay for transportation, if your site is a few miles down from the center, donât expect to get paid for that. ",2
81,"Horrible, wouldn't recommend, stay away, there is something better out there, management culture is horrible, promotions don't exist, no work life balance.",2
792,Terrible director. Had no backbone in hospital with other departments. Often times required staff to do work outside of their job description without any support. Only would hire/ offer hours to per diems who would take on any shift without any notice to avoid offering any stability or benefits. This is only an assessment on this department the northwell organization as a whole is awesome and great to be a part of. ,2

I worked there for a couple years and throughout the time I was there, my job role got bounced around, had a ton of turnover, bunch of new managers and more. Some managers were great, others were so incompetent it would have been laughable had I not been totally messed over all the time. I only worked the job I was hired as for like 6 months before they changed my job role with no notice, explanation or reason whatsoever. Store lead had no care or concern for availability of associates or when asked why job role was changed. Also, they do not care about the safety of the animals whatsoever. Sick animal? Shove it in quarantine until they eventually die. They rarely ever had actual vet visits and many animals could have survived had they seen a vet and weren't just shoved in the quarantine sick room. Tiny Tales cages are death traps and yet they promote them. So much wrong.",2

199,"Asurion seemed like a great place to work until they forced the new sales incentives onto their employees. The inbound call position was nice when actually helping customers, but its obvious that the priorities of the company have changed. When I first started at Asurion, it was clear that servicing the customer's needs was put first. Unfortunately, during my time at Asurion that principle was eventually thrown out the window! They don't care about what you're doing to help, they only care about one thing: Securing the sale. What's worse is that they don't care about how you do it. Whether people are committing sales fraud to ""secure the sale"" or just plain cheating to inflate their numbers, Asurion management will shower you with praise. (Even in their upper management sales meetings!) I also have an abundance of solid evidence to support this claim, as all of our Sales coaching were recorded by myself and management. Most people would think that you were to make a pitch and hopefully the customer might budge. But at Asurion, it wasn't beneath most representatives to ""Assume the Sale"" and was even encouraged! This job is a nightmare for anyone not experienced in sales. Don't recommend this job for the feint of heart. ",2

My managers were really good at being nice at first and then showing their true colors later on.

Don't get me wrong it's a good company, pay and benefits are OK plus stock buy-in but 3 m is a very big company and there are some gaps in it where people are used and abused without notice. What i find hard about 3 m is the people. if you are new you are re guarded with distaste and seem not to matter much I've been told that "" oh you matter now?"" many times after completing my training. Temps get it the worse even though they are potential employees they are demeaned and used like numbers. Many team leads enforce last-minute weekend hours on them and use guilt to make the employees follow through or outright tell them "" you're not cut out for this place if you can't work weekends on short notice"" I understand the need for overtime but to make a person feel like they are not giving all they got for the job is something else. management wants to care but the ones that are on the floor are the enforcers, and they don't care. Even with all of these, I find 3 m OK as long as I keep to myself and don't cause trouble I'm left alone and that's OK with me, if you decide to work here I wish you well and remember it's just a job and there are good and bad days.

I was assigned to assist the twos room. I ended up being co head teacher for twos, pre-k, and pre school. I have 27 kids to two teachers. I had no cleaning crew, I worked 45hours when I was told no more than 30 hrs a week. Head of this center was given zero information nor help to hire more staff. Not one meeting ever happened. Coworkers took 30 plus minute âten minutes breaksâ. I also helped in infants and toddlers and was never responded when I complained to higher up. They set this center to fail and it was no fault of the on campus staff. Everyone tried to give their all, but when understaffed no prep time no cleaning crew and no solid direction to teach it will fail. The families and children are amazing. The teachers I worked with amazing. The infant teacher left after 20 years because the center in Rohnert Parks manager was nonexistent. This center will never succeed with that person running it. Until sheâs gone and real work with a real team of teachers that can be appreciated and heard are hired this center is a loss cause. My heart breaks for families with no options. ",2

I have had many people tell me that capstone should not be at that site anymore. They need to be removed. Overall that company is a joke. They disgraced me and my family.

Upon committing to the project you find that there are additional steps for each task not mentioned previously, making it physically impossible to do in 12.4 seconds per task. Over 21 tasked, i averaged about 1 minute per task which pushed the average project time out to 14 hours. I immediately abandoned the project. A quick google search finds others who have the same project also complaining about the times being not possible. One poster wrote they rushed the project as quick as they could and it still took them 7 hours to complete. All emails to report the issue and explain the additional times are ignored. They know it's not possible to complete the project in the paid time allocated. They're deliberately misleading the task details before you commit to the project, therefore effectively misleading the hourly rate.

If they need help finding something you must help them find what they need or otherwise find someone who can properly assist them in what they may be wanting. Not that there's a problem with helping people, however when they expect stock from the truck to be put away, it's very difficult when you have to go on a scavenger hunt for various items that could take you all across the store. Management had unrealistic expectations and they rode your department hard depending on how the customers reviewed it on their receipt surveys.

Many of my co-workers including myself used the experience working here to move on to sworn law enforcement. It's up to the employee to either grow or stay stagnant. Supervisors here are like anywhere else some were great some were horrible. The wages are decent for the work you are doing. The benefits aren't the greatest. Security = public safety so don't expect to be off on holidays. Overall, would definitely recommend this company. ",1

Advise young people to take this job and don't be afraid to ask what responsibilities you can take on to move up the chain fast.

There was tons of talk behind employees backs from the manager. Getting days off was a struggle. You are expected to do more than a reasonahle amount of work in one shift.

Some employees will get written up for nothing, while others can leave multiple children in the same diaper for 4-5 hours and not be spoken to about it. Employees working at this center are not lead teacher qualified but the parents will be told the employee is a lead teacher. Lots of drama. Employees who cause drama are kept around due to being management's favorites while others are told to just ignore the drama. Overall a toxic workplace with more regard for numbers, money, and enrollment than the actual care of the children. ",2

1034,"I decided to work at Bright Horizons because it was supposedly a top 100 company. It did not live up to the standard. Small mistakes were criticized. There were at least two staff members that regularly bullied others by getting the ear of the management team, who would then make decisions based on complaints. These two ladies regularly overstepped boundaries and caused drama. One was known for screaming at other staff members, even though she had no authority to do so. One was known for screaming at other staff members, even though she had no authority to do so. Another staff member was allowed to complain about others while she herself did very little except for sit around.

She considered involvement to be plopping herself down on the floor or in a chair and having the children come to her. She insulted the children and made coworkers uncomfortable.I was expecting a positive work environment, and instead I felt stressed out, afraid to say the wrong thing. I felt like I was constantly being watched. Also, the work life balance was very unbalanced. Working from nine until six every day takes itâs toll. Sometimes the hours varied a little, but often they did not. I would say that, all in all, I was disappointed. I was expecting a much more supportive environment.

720,"This is a place that I wouldn't refer anyone that I know to work. Management is very horrible & they play the "" Buddy Buddy System "" big time. It's not about how well your job & performance is, it's about who you're cool with or related to. Once I was promoted to Production Manager, things started to shift in my almost 11 year career with Airgas. You're expecting to lead by example but with doing so it falls on deaf ears or you're told you're too hard on people. Once I started just managing the crew I had daily ( like the 2 managers I had ), it became a big problem. The location I worked at had several family members & friends at the same location & you could tell when things came about. Management could definitely be better but after reading multiple reviews, it appears that's the culture with this company. #StayAway..",2

1041,"I was employed for 3 years at GEICO and I must say the first year was great, after that it went downhill. They never hired anyone for the department I worked in, MOAT, and they set these expectations that were over the top for working from home. They donât care about your mental health, youâre just a number to them. They fire you while weâre in a pandemic & for performance but yet their systems constantly crash and headsets never worked. The job is easy but the stress level is at 1000 and you will be mentally exhausted and very overwhelmed. Instead of hiring more agents, they just throw out unlimited overtime. The supervisors are never available, so youâre basically on your own. Everyone says how amazing they hear Geico is, but itâs only because the pay is great. It is not what it seems to be. ",2
438,"First, they asked people to log off because of not enough work. I guess when they did not get enough people to sign off, the next week, they sent a newsletter stating that there were massive errors with their agents and they will be letting people go. I received an email letter saying I did something wrong and I was being fired. Nothing in the letter stated exactly what I did wrong. I was blocked off the website. I could not ask any questions because I was banded. Shady business, I wonder why they were having so many classes. I guess they needed to make money off the sale of the classes. The bottom line I paid for my class and went to class for a month studied, took tests and exams for two weeks of work with pay.",2

519,Working at geico was a very poor experience for me . My mangers and co workers were great but the job itself was not . The hours are super long and they over work you . They are says that I have cried before even coming in because I was so miserable. The calls kept coming back to back without even a break in between. My throat would be hurting so bad at the end of my shift . They have high expectations for you that are to unrealistic to meet and I just became fed up of working here so I quit very glad that I did .,2
382,"When I first started I was under the impression that the salon and everyone that worked in it made plenty of money but I quickly found out that that wasnât true. Working as a Bather was exciting at first because working with dogs and puppies seems fun but then itâs not. As a bather (at my store) I was looked down upon. All the dirty work fell to me. I would close the entire salon by myself Almost everyday. I went from doing 5-6 dogs a day to 13+ without any warning. I felt overwhelmed and overworked all the time. The pay is absolute garbage. While every groomer brought home at least $800, some making up to $1400 a week. I barely made $300. The amount of work that I did and how hard I worked that was like being spit on itâs insulting how hard bathers work and how little we're paid. I found out that I was making petsmart $1000s a week (more than some groomers) while I was only being paid $200. The management basically told me to deal with it whenever I confronted them about my pay. I loved working with the dogs but I hated how I was being taken advantage of. I wouldnât recommend this job to anyone because you are literally the salons slave. I hope it gets better but I doubt it will.",2

The office has been great and I have had no issues. Prove yourself reliable and sober and it goes great.",1
