Respectful and friendly.Pay & benefitsGood health insurance and 401kJob security and advancementIf you are hardworking and you are honest you will have a job!OverallRetired after 35+ years with this great company! Would not have been able to retire without the pay and benefits this company offers. It's hard work but rewarding!,1
4,"The good about working at stanley black and decker is, the consistent team work and working ethic. Now as to anything bad, I have never experienced that as such.",1
5,"Work sites was interesting, me great people that gave me a broader look on different aspects of careers and life. Good for part-time income but that about it.",1
6,"Clinic is constantly short staffed and management does not look for coverage to help the clinic. No hazard pay for working with positive covid 19 patients. Costly health insurance with bad coverage. New employees start and quit right away without finishing training, low starting wages compared to other dialysis companies.",2
7,"The team at the location I work, is amazing, supportive, and works well TOGETHER! * This is a VERY important key to a great work environment *We learn from each other; We make work enjoyable, even on the bad days of cranky customers-- which our not-so crankies outweigh our crankies! Work-Life Balance is great! We all understand ""life happens"" and we are willing to work with what comes our way-- Support!",1
9,Terrible company.. wouldnât recommend to anyone. The commission is too low. Claims take too long to be paid. You are always the 5th or 6th rep to call on a business.,2
10,"It is a great place to work. During my transition from being a food delivery driver to transitioning to a full time LTL truck driver, it has been a great task. An even greater reward is working with Old Dominion Freight Line has taught me how to pull heavy freight of 20,000 + pounds. After being here for this limited time, I fully and confidently know that I can haul anything at anytime or anywhere.",1
12,"Workplace culture is extremely variable and dependent on advisor. Personal experience would have been more positive and productive if PI was held responsible for their expected duties. Scheduling meetings, editing manuscripts, and troubleshooting experiments was very difficult and when I approached management about the situation my only recourse was to accept or change labs.",2
13,would like the managers to be more invested with the associates. Less company meeting should assign or hire people to get buggy from the parking lots managers should follow company rules that is set for Every one. Stop having favours of people that gets special attention. Be fair ,2
14,Good job for college student working part time. If you like sports it's a fun job. Pay isn't too great but okay for a job in retail. Good store to have in the area,1
15,Love it work when and where I want to work. I make my own schedule don't report to anyone. I can take whatever orders I want I start as early as I want and work as late as I want,1
16,I dont have much to say about this company. I don't think it's fair how they treat the temps when it comes to hiring or learning a new position or trying.,2
17,I love my job and the people around. Just wish we was appreciated more then shown. It's like our voices are not heard when its pertaining the client.If you don't work at this location you'll never know what it feels like being the ones to be picked out. We've had a few of managers and onsites that was not too good but we can't be held accountable for their actions. Overall HD is a great company to work for. I worked with them 4 years as a temp on an assignment before becoming the supervisor.,1
19,"Awesome company to work for, checks are always correct, they compliment you on doing a great job, and your hard work never goes unnoticed and the benefits are reasonable ",1
21,â?OverallI enjoy the autonomy and flexibility of this job! Postmates as a whole finds multiple ways to make sure that drivers are beneficially protected! Iâm sure that if I lived in a different location my experience would be greater!,1
23,Donât waste your time with this company very high turn over rate. The management should not be in management most are uneducated and not qualified to manager toddlers ,2
24,"First internship was this past summer with MFC, my team was super helpful even in a virtual environment giving me all the resources and tools needed to be a valuable contributor to the team. Management was always easy to talk to and the company values its interns. ",1
25,"Busy, challenging, fun, can be cold in winter and hot in the summer. There is always something to do there. Lunch is 45min long which is nice. Holiday pay comes in handy. Longevity of employment runs through that place.",1
28,"Heinz was a nice place to work, the culture and people there are really great. I made a lot of lifelong friends there. There was only one thorn in that rose bush, if you know what I mean. I can't say anything bad about the company as a whole, I only had a bad experience with one person and he was fired years ago. Overall its a very good and stable company.",1
29,"This place is a joke and pays you peanuts for all that hard work. The only thing that is good about working here is that you learn new things. Other than that, this place is bunk.",2
31,"I worked on the cashier and did stocking sometimes. Pretty cool, can get busy but nothing I couldn't handle. Nice working around different pets all day. One customer even came in with a little finger monkey!",1
34,"ManagementIn general, managers at AutoNation only care about their pay check. They will pack the shop with unexperienced techs to bring the productivity up. Then find and excuse to fire them in the slow season. They want you to bend over backwards for them but don't expect the same from them.",2
35,I worked for The Reynolds and Reynolds Company for 3 years. I don't think I met one person that was truly satisfied with their position. My direct supervisor was an emotionally abusive bully. There is no HR department to report the harassment to. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone. The only positive memories I have are the gym and food.,2
37,Great teamwork and recognition. Workload and metrics are achievable but intense. Easy to burn out. Lots of internal competition for open roles. Leadership training was not consistently required. ,1
39,"Started out really great pay per work performed balanced. After 2.5 years, this has turned out to be the worst place to work ever. Coaches are so afraid of loosing their jobs so they micromanage you like Iâve never seen before. They are young and challenged themselves. Company cares NOTHING about the customerâs issues itâs All about selling MyHome+ On every call. Thirsty for sales like never before! They have unrealistic expectations for employees. I was hired for tech support not selling no dumb warranty. STAY AWAY FROM This MESS of a JOB!",2
40,Good place to work. I worked there for 29 years. I left for a career opportunity. I learned a lot working at Smith barney/ morgan stanley. I would work there again,1
41,"Great exposure to countless companies in an instant. Easy to use and more importantly, easy to connect. Great Place friendly people This is the largest Hospital chain in new york",1
42,good job when youâre a teen! this was my first job. i just have to leave a review but it was wonderful lol i made good money as well! it was very easy ,1
44,"Dont work for this company, I'm a current employee. At first I love this job learned new things and skills. But now the company is changing but not for the better, new regulations and new policies are being put out making the working environment more stressful, hours change consistently and are not flexible, managment are lousy and not up front with their employees. I work the night shift or as we call it the graveyard shift everything we do for this company is not recognizes or appreciated",2
45,Learned a lot about leadership at this company. The subject matter experts are always if you have questions. Well managed company with very well leaders.,1
48,"This is a fast-paced company with amazing talented people all around. I thrive on it. Contact center employees truly care for each other and the customers they are working with. The culture is second to none. There is a high value placed on integrity, extra efforts that you bring, and diversity. ",1
49,Good Benefits. Competitive pay. Growth opportunities. Lots of locations. Very corporate environmental. Diverse. Strong leadership. Good coworkers. Nice. ,1
50,Respect was key. All employees had valuable opinions. I would still be there if my outreach position wasn't downsized. I worked as a Human Resources and Outreach Coordinator for five years. I won monetary awards every year for recruitment and my excellent writing skills.,1
51,"It is a very sad career and could be depressing. If you make it as a manager, it could be very lucrative. Other than that you are supposed to make tons of calls daily, daily meetings, seminar/learning zoom calls. The amount of work doesnât not compensate for the possible payout. One thing I have to say is that people are great but do not let them influence you with all the promises and dreams that youâll become successful in this job, they make it sound easy but it is not at all! ",2
53,Great place to work with many people & kids at every location! Not many opportunities to move up but can often move classrooms & get exposure to other age groups ,1
54,This job taught me a lot about changing tires and working as a team. The company provided all the necessary tools needed to complete any task that was given to me.,1
55,I started here a few months ago and im 19 and i haven't looked back. The people here are honest and they believe in their job of helping others. First week of working and i was welcomed and treated with respect i had never had. For someone who was always the youngest in the room i found people here who have sincerely changed my life becoming mentors and friends. They help keep you up on the bad days and there are a few...but they look to drive you like a family.,1
56,"I like working here because it is a teaching hospital. There are residents, fellows and attendings so there is support and many perspectives. A provider is typically accessible. They have residency for new grad RNs. ",1
58,"Itâs an okay place to work at first, then when youâve been working a while you really start to see this is not a good job. First off the pay is wayyyyyy off from what they advertise on Indeed, thatâs number one. Number 2 they donât provide you with ANYTHING if you wanna work from home you must have everything already, minus the headset. They have a billion chat rooms, and very hard to navigate if youâre new to working from home. They automatically set your tax status without an explanation on how to change or adjust it. HR definitely hard to get in touch w, and the help desk is not very helpful either. If you can just avoid this place, the only freedom you really have is when youâre not working, which is very rare and the scheduling is bad too. Just donât itâs really not worth the time or stress. ",2
59,"They constantly put temps into production with little training. Once they were experienced, there was usually a lay off so that experience was lost. Making improvements was an act in futility. I hear it's gotten much worse in 2020, with many rounds of layoffs. ",2
60,"Great team work among members. Management listened to team member's suggestions and feedback. A typical day included organizing your work production, making necessary calls, reviewing cases. Sometimes the hardest part during certain times of the year was staying caught up. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers and coworkers. ",1
61,very stressful when busy since you have to try to be fast and the management was so poor whenever you asked for time off it would get denied and i rescheduled you even if you had school ,2
62,Poor management. Trucks always break down. Union is a joke. Lots of nonsense to deal with. Routes come and go. Over time is based on rate pay. Not a safe environment.,2
63,"Coworkers were nice, management couldnt get their act together to save their lives, to much work for only 2 people, no life/work balance, major time crunch with way to much work, GA office is the redhead step child.",2
64,"Worked in the North Charleston location for a short time 8 months, wish I didn't have to move. Had a great experience. Yes, you work hard get paid well, the benefits are great. For the guy who made that statement about Allen, you are off, you must have been one of the ones that had everyone carrying you, not pulling your weight. Allen is extremely fair and wants everyone who wants to succeed to succeed. So you must have done a poor job, or just there for a paycheck, he is looking for people wanting a career. you are way off. ",1
69,"Job security and advancementI think this is a good company. Just not this department or supervisors. One supervisor is a micro micro manager who accuses you of lying when you provide honest feeedback. Also raises his voice and is extremely difficult. other supervisor is insincere and ineffective, playing favorites and not overseeing her own staffâs quality of work. Zero appreciation for hard , sincere workers.OverallGood company, bad management and they hire and play favorites. Avoid. Choose a different job site at a different department with different management.",2
70,"The job itself isnât bad and the coworkers and team leads are fine (to some degree) however the office management of this location is absent minded and sluggish. Often schedules donât take account of availability, so why ask if it wonât be respected. The HR is lazy and refuses to do their job correctly. Pretty unprofessional environment. They are in need of people but refuses to hire more or schedule correctly. You will apply for this position and wait a month before even being called just to receive an incorrect pay wage and placed on a day against your availability. They expect professionalism from you but wonât do it themselves.",2
71,"During the hiring process they promise you incentives and get you all revved up just to kick you in teeth after a few days working there. I would like to say that there were some very nice, helpful people but the management for Capstone is atrocious. The trainer we had was not friendly at all if anything he made us more nervous by barking instructions. I received a write up for having errors during my first day of being out on the floor alone after being assured by the trainer that it wouldn't be held against me since it was my first day. They do not have sufficient equipment for all the people that are picking, if you don't have what is needed then you have to borrow one from a co-worker causing a slow down which in turn is held against you if you're too slow. I would not recommend this job to anyone. ",2
73,"Management and benefits are excellent. I feel well supported and love what I do and grateful for this company. I've never had issues with not having enough hours, and always felt supported by my clinical team. ",1
74,"Because of a sever back problem and I could not drive to work anymore, BAE refused to let me work at home. So if I could not drive to work anymore under doctors orders and I could not work at home, they threw me out and I could not even get unemployment benefits. BAE is a terrible company,",2
77,Management is horrible. They nit pick. Expectations of work life arenât realistic. You have to punch a time clock working in corporate. Not very flexible about vacation time,2
78,I only worked at the property for 6 shifts and almost every shift the sheriff's department would be at our property for one reason or another. The staff is also disrespectful to management and guests.,2
79,When you join the company you are awed at the point when they say you can make six figures while working like your own boss. Then you realize it is all compensation based with no base income. The customers are rude and the contacts are disorganized. You call people from the system that are annoyed and already canceled their policies. There is a lot of turnover and honestly I wish I came to my senses sooner. ,2
80,"It is a good Job. I am an SMT Operator and make, as of 10/18/20, $17.35 per Hour. The managers and leaders are nice but the decisions they make half the time dont make since and wind up being less efficient. There are coolers to put your lunch box in and the cafeteria is open Mon-Thur 6am-2pm. You have to pay for food but they serve many things for breakfast and lunch. It is a bit overpriced but there are fast food places near by. The Shifts are:1st Mon-Thur am 10 hrs, 2nd Mon-Thur pm hrs, 3rd Fri-Sun am 12hrs, 4th Fri-Sun pm 12hrs. You get paid progressively more to work 2nd, 3rd, and 4th shift then 1st shift BUT you wind up making the same salary because you work less hours. Overtime is usually available for a 1st and 2nd shift workers but 3rd and 4th usually have a very hard time getting overtime since 1st and 2nd shift have enough people but 3rd and 4th shift have very little people. They are mostly willing to train you on new things, which is nice if you want more ability to work overtime in other areas of the factory. You get 2 paid 15min breaks and 1 un-paid 30min lunch. Also it is very difficult to get fired. If you are late every day, Miss a day or 2 (no call no show), dont work very hard, and/or just call in once in a while they seem to not fire anyone unless you do something very bad like: Sleep on the Job, Harassment, Disrespect the Managers. ect.",1
81,Really enjoyed working for this company. They train well and are always there if you have any questions. There is a lot of room to improve and move up within the company.,1
83,"This Eaton site is the most terrible place a person can ever work at. The ""leadership team"" and HR are full of hypocrites and unethical people. You would be told that you matter, but then they stab you in the back when you do the right things. Clearly, there is no such thing as a perfect workplace, but this site is the most toxic place a person can be exposed to. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!",2
86,"I have been working in Ibex for a year now & I never had any issues with my shift since I enjoy my day-offs with my family. It's an easy to adjust night shift work with paid allowances on time, I got my first 13 month bonus on time no tax & VL pay is soon to come this Feb salary. Let's come & join Ibex and enjoy the company of bright young people!",1
87,A typical day with work flow to keep you busy. Training classes for new banking system for good performance. Good leadership and very diverse. Meeting deadlines every day as team work make it more enjoyable.,1
89,"Iâd definitely go back and work... easy pay and easy staff, less pressure and cool customers. Iâve worked here for a years on and off and would definitely return",1
90,We are so fast to just to let someone take another job and wonât even try to make them stay. They act like we can just hire anyone of the street. If a employee is struggling to make ends meet they wonât even offer anything as to extra hours to overtime. They wouldnât even offer a package of some sort if you tested for positive for COVID. Our competition did that for there employees! They are more focused on what benefits them instead of listening to there employees.,2
92,"Plenty of training, people with great knowledge to lend a hand, off site help whenever you need it. Fun, nice people to work with and for. Always a way to move up in the company. Great opportunities.",1
93,many technical challenges management is spportive and unbiased its a good place to learn promotions are available and tarining is substantial make sure to be on time ,1
95,"The day I finished training course, there was 100 long-term employees that walked out the door (quit their jobs). I have scheduled surgery planned for weekend after training period. Approved by my training manager but when the time came my time off request disappeared from their records and I was out of a job when I came back from the surgery. ",2
98,The managers only hire who they like to be for supervisors they have a policy to hire within but they hired without people being at the company for 10-12 years and still haven't made supervisor because account manager only like who they an cheat you out of your pay sometime,2
99,Nothing to good for this company my team lead was trained with the class and is no help for anyone you can't ask for help because she knows just what you know ,2
100,"I'm currently a sub staff, but I loved working there full time. It was a great place to work. I fully enjoyed my experience with them. Good pay and felt appreciated.",1
101,"Facebook hires very very young and extremely bright young people from all over the world. They then provide you with what I felt was an MBA level training in how to work the right way. This included: dealing with conflict (fast feedback), meeting cadences, star charts to evaluate work and get buy-in from peers on priorities, gobs and gobs of information and documents to do your job. BUT, and it's a big but, it is all self-directed. In other words, you must be able to thrive in ambiguity and be motivated to seek out the info you need. It won't be handed to you.",1
103,"Creepy spyware required which takes your picture every 10 minutes. Meetings are recorded and all communication with co-workers can be seen by Big Brother. This company is Bizzare. They might as well hire robots, there is no interest in the human component of an employee. Only work here if you are absolutely desperate.",2
104,Itâs a good place communication sucks though. I didnât receive the help on how to be successful though. The pay was really good. My headset was broken and I had to go spend my own money on a new one. And on top of that I had COVID.,2
105,"This place runs ok with no management. They simply don't care anything about you, it is just all about production. Becoming more like a sweat shop everyday. They keep adding to the work load and either no raises or some cases dropping pay. Department manager has no class.. Both department could do better if they actually sat down and listen to the employees. If you have a problem and need HR assistance, might as well forget about that, you will get the run around and no answers. Great coworkers to work with but could use more teamwork skills. ",2
106,"â Work-life balanceThey claim work life balance is great, but in order to hit the numbers they require, it takes many more hours than they lead you to believe.â Pay & benefitsHe talks a big game when it comes to pay and bonuses but does not deliver. The bonus structure was allegedly being redone when I was hired, but the ânew planâ was never presented to me and when I asked about it, a much different plan was presented than was discussed at my offer meeting but I was already stuck in that position.â Job security and advancementPeople are disposable to them. If you donât blindly follow their beliefs, they will just get rid of you.â ManagementThey claim âthey do the right thing, because itâs the right thing.â They also insist on asking ILLEGAL questions in interviews. Discrimination means nothing to them, despite there being laws. One candidate was overlooked âbc of twitches.â That could be from Touretteâs or some other medical condition but instead of âdoing the right thing,â he was turned down.â CultureThey seem nice at first but itâs a facade. Proceed with caution.â OverallThey like to sweet talk and make it sound like that office is much different than other work environments and âthey do the right thing,â but they donât follow through because their intentions are not genuine. They claim to be âinclusive and diverseâ but they are very much not. They love asking ILLEGAL questions in interviews, even after I informed them they cannot ask certain questions (due to discrimination). Actions speak louder than words. They also claim to do volunteer work, but IâmÂ -Â more...",2
107,It's a fantastic company to work for. The inmates for the most part are really good workers. It opened my eyes to the struggles of re-entry into society which led me to help teach the N2Work program so their transition maybe easier. I really love the fact that Aramark does this.,1
108,"Good experience with the company this far, the interview went well this is done through the home of the invdidual patients whom need care. This is primarily done with the families in interviewing and Easter Seals with the hiring",1
110,"KinderCare is a great place, a beautiful daycare with a good system but the behind the scenes Corporate SUCKS! The pay is so little compared to how much they make off workers , itâs very stressful and sometimes management is like the blind leading the blind because corporate doesnât properly train them at all. Itâs literally a guess what my role is today when working with management. The turn over rate is sky high . But the positive of all of this are the children, dedicated staff and the parents . The curriculum is beautifully executed and parents are very open and inviting . ",2
113,"I enjoyed working here, wasnt to busy with the phones which made the day go by slow but they allowed me to train in different departments such as warranty and cashiering. Also had free lunches sometimes which was nice",1
115,Itâs all about your work ethic. A job is a commitment. I went to work and did my job. My supervisors were helpful and stood up for me any time I had an issue. I enjoyed my time with GDIT,1
116,Wouldnât recommend the place snakes and liars they will promise you the moon then not deliver waste of time the coworkers are just as bad as the manager ,2
117,Good to work for. Hardest part of the job is the ever changing government policy and to keep up with that. Liked the holidays off and earning time off.,1
120,Great experience on clinical rotations. I personally was not employed by TJUH but got a good sense of the positive environment and would recommend it to others. ,1
121,"Freelancing with Upwork has given me an opportunity to ""meet"" and work with many different types of people. I have definitely learned a lot about how to best interface with clients for a mutually satisfying project.",1
127,"never have i ever worked for a more horrible company. conditions in the trucks are horrible. the A/C in a armored truck is a requirement since the windows dont roll down and you as a driver will be fired if you leave the truck at any time no matter how hot it gets in those trucks, a 80* day outside is a 120*+ in those trucks. the corporate refused to fix the vehicals and god forbid you truck breaks on route, regardless if its do to the lack of maintenance that the company give their trucks you will be blamed for the truck breaking down. the managers could care less if you get hurt or not. had a manager tell me and my messenger, after we spent 10+ hours in a truck that was in access of 110*, and i quote ""i told you the trucks got hot"". i turned in my 2 weeks that day and left. i will never go back to that company, specifically the Wichita depo. horrible management, horrible company just horrible. do not work for this company.",2
128,I worked here for a little while and quit abruptly when my manager started to bully and intimidate me. I would say this guy is an alcoholic and by his abusive nature say hes been like this for a long time. REMX is the worst large recruiting shop out there to work for. Management is good at recruiting but not managing and this guy I worked for was the best liar to get you in a job I have ever seen. They were so desperate.,2
131,Mostly nice coworkers. Very high standards and low compensation. Anything and everything you can think of is donated. Processing donations is often disgusting and even hazardous with sharp objects and broken glass throughout.,1
132,You will not have the ability to choose which shift you are placed on. There is plenty of overtime. All temps are hired to cover seniority per men any employees when they are out from work for various reasons.,2
133,"I hate to give a bad review to the company, because the company as whole seems to be genuinely a good company to work. However, the site I was located at was the complete opposite. Management (excluding the site supervisor) was full of a bunch of hypercritical, non professional individuals who enforced their political beliefs and own made up rules into effect. As for HR and payroll, they were extremely unorganized and were non responsive when you needed to get a hold of them. The short 4 months I worked there I was only issued one shirt that was a pass-down from a former employee which was a 4XL shirt that was way to big on me and I had to purchase the steel-toed boots and pants. Nonetheless, a new supervisor was hired a month after me and received all of their uniforms as well as steel toed boots not even two weeks of working there. If you are going to work for Allied in Farmington, I suggest not working at Westmoreland SJM and to not depend on HR for anything to get done.",2
134,"Currently employed but only due to the pay and benefits, my supervisor is great, the rest of management is horrible. Lots of nepotism in promotions, unsafe work environment, you feel no value as an employee, zero engagement from management, seems bad behavior is rewarded and good behavior is over looked. No bonues, no thank yous, half the time you have to fight to get what is rightfully yours to begin with and then you are marked for going nowhere. Was good when I started many years ago, has went dramatically downhill since. ",2
135,"Tl;dr RUN AWAY to a company that cares about your health and safety. COVID personnel beware! This company is asking staff to re-use PPE (âN95âs should be kept and re-used for a weekâ?and âface shields should be reused as long as possibleâ?. This is a dangerous practice only approved during the height of the pandemic.When asked what happens if we donât want to reuse: âI have to answer to the higher ups on why weâre using so much PPEâ? What?! As much as this companies charge productions like NBC and Universal, they can most certainly afford to provide their RNs and NPs with adequate PPE.This company prioritizes profits over providing nurses what they need to stay safe.$75/hr ($50+$25 COVID diff) is great, but itâs not enough to make me want to get COVID. Youâve been warned.",2
136,"As this being my first job it was a great job to work at. The people there were great and are really good people. They made me feel welcome, made me look forward to working there, and I enjoyed working there.",1
137,I was a production worker and you never knew what schedule you were going to work. Too much overtime and never ending supply of new people coming in door but never trained and didn't stay.,2
138,"Good work/life balance with reasonable pay. Good Diversity in the company and management and fair treatment. Maintain good customer service, follow up systematically",1
139,"The job itself is very easy and simple. The management is always overtop and critical no matter how much work you do it is never enough while others are lazy and do nothing, it seems as though the management comes down on the hard workers instead to cover the poor ones. The pay per hour is pitiful considering how much the company makes and the physical and mental toll a 30 minute break and two 20s are not enough for the amount of standing and walking you have to do. They say you get paid breaks but you really donât considering you have to come in early and stay later than what would make a 10 hours shift so you are really on an 11 hour shift including you are expected to work exactly until itâs break time then walk to the break room which can be more than a 5 minute walk and be back working at the exact time your break is scheduled to end which really makes it two 10s and a 20. You get very few days off they are unforgiving towards personal situations for every 6 months you get 20 hours paid time off and 40 hours unpaid any time over and you get terminated. This time off includes all situations including court, care for children or family, and vacation. The managers will talk down and never really answer any questions you have only giving a generic or basic response which gives you little to no information. I urge anyone who wants to work here only do it seasonly do not make it a career I am in college trying to make some money and they very unforgiving when it comes to your personal life or problems.",2
140,By far the worse place to work. Employees are over worked and Geico expects their employess to read work related emails during lunch or before or after work without getting paid. Only lasted one year and I was miserable the entire time. ,2
142,Poor management and treat employees like a number. No training most of the time you have to figure it out on your own. Managers favor those kisses up to them.,2
143,"They have no structure. They expect you to work 12 hour days Monday-Friday and then half a day on Saturday. They do not care about you having a family that you would like to spend time with. They underpay all their employees even the part time employees. If you ask for a raise as a manager they just give you a run around. You canât go to your boss and ask for help because they wonât help you. If you need to file an HR complaint on your boss, you can send it in but nothing is done about it. ",2
145,Workplace culture was horrible I didnât like it as a substitute everyone looked to me as someone who wasnât educated enough to complete the job.the hardest part was for me to come in as needed ready to work and the employees werenât accepting or trying to help with the things they knew about there center to inform me ,2

148,"The only good thing about this place is that after 90 days you can request and modify your schedule. There are so many detailed expectations for all agents and you must maintain a score of 94 percent which isnt impossible when the software they use for captioning is OLD and very slow. I wish they would have spent a little more money on developing a better program that doesnt get stuck and fail us everyday and gets worse as call volume increases. And yes agents are tested on calls and regardless of their choppy software, slow computers and non working headsets. they show no sympathy when you fail your weekly tests due to technical issues. High expectations with tools to do the job that RARELY are functional. ",2

I was actually in an account about a week ago and a supervisor was there the day before when the delivery was sent and it's funny how I ask to see who is logged in yesterday and they told me that the person did not sign in and to top it off the person did a horrible job with the delivery didn't work all the pallets and also front ends were all fronted and we're not allowed to do that and we will get in penalized if we do that but it's OK for supervisors to do it. poor management I must say also .its too many products too many expectations for too little pay .,2

We are told to not turn any family or child away despite reaching capacity and overcrowding that goes against CDC guidelines every day. We have not closed once since March. No hazard pay. With children only being in Zoom school for two hours each day, we are now their teachers for the remainder of the time they are there from 6am to 6:30pm. AVOID ANY BGC DURING THE PANDEMIC. High-stress job, horrible benefits, frequent burnout, high turnover rates...the list goes on. The only positives are making a difference in children's lives, but a lot of the kids' behavior is absolutely awful and there's nothing you can do about it.

Training is next to none. They WILL throw you to the wolves. Management is very clicky and advancement is not based on skills itâs based on favoritism. There will be judgement and they will yâall down on people and write you up for almost anything. They are not kind or family oriented. This is note a rage review that is written from a one sided point of view. This is an honest review that reveals what no one will ever confirm due to fear they will be fired.

She bullied & verbally insulted me & my coworker the first week on the job. My coworker quit the 2nd week. I complained to HR on more then one occasion but I was later terminated for misconduct. They told me I most likely would not be able to collect unemployment. They were wrong. TWC found no misconduct on my part. My FA also marked me as not rehirable.

It's full commission, however your upline will try and control (for their benefit, not yours) your day by day activities and total outbound calls. Leads are scarce and often very poor. Almost always are recycled and working leads that were called and even closed a month ago.

I only stayed as long as I did due to making so many friends and not having a single second to ever think or reflect on what I was doing ( a typical work day was 7am and at times I was still up at 12pm, usually worked 7 days a week). There is potential to make good money and I did for awhile, but at the risk of being screwed over by higher ups and writing policies at the HIGHEST premiums available, and being trained to continually lie to customers. They are 100 years behind every other insurance company and policies are trailed for diabetes and can take months to get an answer. After leaving, my pending policies commissions went to my upline, and the agency owner placed a vector in my name for chargebacks (which would have been paid off by my approved policies) TWO days after leaving the company to try to prevent me from getting appointed with another company. If you are new to insurance, you typically receive a bill in the mail and are given time to pay it off before getting reported to vector. Managers would purposefully ignore customers calls requesting to cancel or change policies. Just dont do it. ",2

279,"Would not recommend. Terrible hours and it was difficult to get time off. If you do manage to get time off, don't get sick. If you get sick, any approved vacation time is taken away and the vacation hours are applied to the days you were out sick. They have recently purchased other health insurance companies (Wellcare, Magellan, Anthem) and they are laying off thousands of employees because they are in the red. This happens often. When they purchased Healthnet a few years ago they let go of several long time Healthnet employees. If you want stability avoid Centene at all costs.",2
281,"Bright horizons does not care about its employees. All they care about is making money off of clients (families). Staff are never supported by management. The schedule changes almost every day, and you rarely get to leave when your shift is supposed to be over. Leadership is unorganized, bad at communication, unsupportive, and overall petty and rude. They talk about staff members behind their backs, then get passive aggressive and rude when you donât let them walk all over you. Although they offer benefits, they do not have a great health insurance plan. Most employees are very unsatisfied, which creates a negative work environment.

The upper management sucked and the work culture was terrible. It has an incredible turnover rate. Overall it's clear what they expect and if you can stick it out until you get promoted off the call floor you're fine. ",2

Geico is really a âfend for yourselfâ?workplace, half the time you need help with a policyholder all of the sups are magically in a meeting with management. The metric are extremely unreasonable but it if youâre lucky, youâll get your 62 level and be able to post out to another department that isnât equally as bad. Since I was there, I had 3 sups post. Before I quit, I absolutely loved my sup, he was amazing and genuinely tried to help. But, others honestly donât really care and are rude, especially most of the female supervisors, theyâll go out of your way to make you feel stupid. Keep in mind, if you apply, this isnât a job where you can get âcomfortableâ?and slack off after your training, you have to continuously be meeting the metric standards otherwise they will fire you. Geico also goes through seasons where when they are introducing a bunch of new hires, theyâll fire atleast 40% of the floor to make room.",2
