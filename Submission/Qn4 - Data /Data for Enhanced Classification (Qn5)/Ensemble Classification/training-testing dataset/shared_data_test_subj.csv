232,Ibex is a great place to work for growth or as a stepping stone. A place where u can be yourself in a fun enviroment. The Operations team - actually cares for their employees.,1
21,â?OverallI enjoy the autonomy and flexibility of this job! Postmates as a whole finds multiple ways to make sure that drivers are beneficially protected! Iâm sure that if I lived in a different location my experience would be greater!,1
42,good job when youâre a teen! this was my first job. i just have to leave a review but it was wonderful lol i made good money as well! it was very easy ,1
50,Respect was key. All employees had valuable opinions. I would still be there if my outreach position wasn't downsized. I worked as a Human Resources and Outreach Coordinator for five years. I won monetary awards every year for recruitment and my excellent writing skills.,1
277,Always full support form management. I am able to work when I want and love what I do! Awesome company with plenty of room for advancement if desired.,1
225,"Ok pay, long time drivers started being paid less then new inexperienced drivers. Will fire you over one accident no matter how minor. You rarely know before the night before what your doing the next day, consistently changes no effective communication. Cruddy hours during winter months, overworked during summer. ",1
235,Great company to work for. They train you the right way. And look out for you if you have problems. Great staff to work with. Everybody helps you out the best way they can. ,1
198,Find a sense of belonging and find a family. Become apart of something that can never die.Learn about sacrifice and discipline.Be motivated and be great.,1
206,"Childcare staff incredibly underpaid, especially during the pandemic. We get just 1 hour of PTO for every 40 hours of work. Only a few paid holidays off. We are told to not turn any family or child away despite reaching capacity and overcrowding that goes against CDC guidelines every day. We have not closed once since March. No hazard pay. With children only being in Zoom school for two hours each day, we are now their teachers for the remainder of the time they are there from 6am to 6:30pm. AVOID ANY BGC DURING THE PANDEMIC. High-stress job, horrible benefits, frequent burnout, high turnover rates...the list goes on. The only positives are making a difference in children's lives, but a lot of the kids' behavior is absolutely awful and there's nothing you can do about it. If you enjoy being paid $13 an hour, being physically and verbally abused by children, no breaks/lunch breaks, poor benefits, bare minimum PTO, and putting yourself at risk of contracting Covid everyday because neither company nor staff follow CDC guidelines then this is the job for you!",1
233,Looking for better. The job has no place for advancements. The work there is sort of stressful. They bring people from outside instead of promoting within.,1
172,A typical work day would be from 5-6am till finish and if you get stuck with 16 pallets as I have well you are in for a treat lol. they won't send any help all they care is about the numbers as you are one your self they never bother to ask if you need any help since some times we have a double delivery in one day they can care less I actually thought this was a great company but the turn over is fast here Don't wast your time PEPSI PAYS ABOUT $5.00 MORE FOR THE SAME JOB with less hassle and they do send help when you have about 6 pallets . I was actually in an account about a week ago and a supervisor was there the day before when the delivery was sent and it's funny how I ask to see who is logged in yesterday and they told me that the person did not sign in and to top it off the person did a horrible job with the delivery didn't work all the pallets and also front ends were all fronted and we're not allowed to do that and we will get in penalized if we do that but it's OK for supervisors to do it. poor management I must say also .its too many products too many expectations for too little pay .,1
158,I really liked working at Parker. Good people. It's very lean. They need more people and resources to accomplish the mission. They treated me well while I was there.,1
98,The managers only hire who they like to be for supervisors they have a policy to hire within but they hired without people being at the company for 10-12 years and still haven't made supervisor because account manager only like who they an cheat you out of your pay sometime,1
155,Tough hours and no time for family or friends. Management is not looking out for the best interest of their employees as they have to look good to corporate officers.,1
58,"Itâs an okay place to work at first, then when youâve been working a while you really start to see this is not a good job. First off the pay is wayyyyyy off from what they advertise on Indeed, thatâs number one. Number 2 they donât provide you with ANYTHING if you wanna work from home you must have everything already, minus the headset. They have a billion chat rooms, and very hard to navigate if youâre new to working from home. They automatically set your tax status without an explanation on how to change or adjust it. HR definitely hard to get in touch w, and the help desk is not very helpful either. If you can just avoid this place, the only freedom you really have is when youâre not working, which is very rare and the scheduling is bad too. Just donât itâs really not worth the time or stress. ",1
90,We are so fast to just to let someone take another job and wonât even try to make them stay. They act like we can just hire anyone of the street. If a employee is struggling to make ends meet they wonât even offer anything as to extra hours to overtime. They wouldnât even offer a package of some sort if you tested for positive for COVID. Our competition did that for there employees! They are more focused on what benefits them instead of listening to there employees.,1
138,"Good work/life balance with reasonable pay. Good Diversity in the company and management and fair treatment. Maintain good customer service, follow up systematically",1
231,"If you want to work for a company that literally runs you ragged, who only gives you 24hr notice of what shift you will work next, who will expect you in after working you 17 hours on 2nd shift and then tell you that you have to work 3rd shift and give you only 2 hours to sleep and tell you they will write you up if you donât agree, then by all means work here. Training is next to none. They WILL throw you to the wolves. Management is very clicky and advancement is not based on skills itâs based on favoritism. There will be judgement and they will yâall down on people and write you up for almost anything. They are not kind or family oriented. This is note a rage review that is written from a one sided point of view. This is an honest review that reveals what no one will ever confirm due to fear they will be fired. OSHA should frequently go here as they are extremely unsafe and do not care about health or safety. If you have a family DO NOT work here. ",1
103,"Creepy spyware required which takes your picture every 10 minutes. Meetings are recorded and all communication with co-workers can be seen by Big Brother. This company is Bizzare. They might as well hire robots, there is no interest in the human component of an employee. Only work here if you are absolutely desperate.",1
110,"KinderCare is a great place, a beautiful daycare with a good system but the behind the scenes Corporate SUCKS! The pay is so little compared to how much they make off workers , itâs very stressful and sometimes management is like the blind leading the blind because corporate doesnât properly train them at all. Itâs literally a guess what my role is today when working with management. The turn over rate is sky high . But the positive of all of this are the children, dedicated staff and the parents . The curriculum is beautifully executed and parents are very open and inviting . ",1
73,"Management and benefits are excellent. I feel well supported and love what I do and grateful for this company. I've never had issues with not having enough hours, and always felt supported by my clinical team. ",1
181,Sitel is awesome place to work. The supervisors make sure your time is correct and take the time to adjust to everything. Sitel also offer PTO and care about well being,1
55,I started here a few months ago and im 19 and i haven't looked back. The people here are honest and they believe in their job of helping others. First week of working and i was welcomed and treated with respect i had never had. For someone who was always the youngest in the room i found people here who have sincerely changed my life becoming mentors and friends. They help keep you up on the bad days and there are a few...but they look to drive you like a family.,1
131,Mostly nice coworkers. Very high standards and low compensation. Anything and everything you can think of is donated. Processing donations is often disgusting and even hazardous with sharp objects and broken glass throughout.,1
23,Donât waste your time with this company very high turn over rate. The management should not be in management most are uneducated and not qualified to manager toddlers ,1
165,Northwell Health is a great place to work. I do enjoy my workplace and am thankful for the numerous opportunities that have been given to me in my time here.,1
182,Stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not a good working environment at all!!!! Itâs not a bad job. Way to much b.s!!! The pay check is ok but thatâs about it.,1
285,If your looking for something long term look as where. The training is horrible and the trainers could be a tad bit rude. The pay is okay for the campaign but it could be better. Training is long and can be aggravating and boring due to system issues not working and your sitting 3-4 hours.,1
14,Good job for college student working part time. If you like sports it's a fun job. Pay isn't too great but okay for a job in retail. Good store to have in the area,1
93,many technical challenges management is spportive and unbiased its a good place to learn promotions are available and tarining is substantial make sure to be on time ,1
218,"Donât get hurt on the job here because they will refuse your workers comp and make you feel less than. I gave this job my all and they destroyed my quality of life. Not worth it because they run you ragged here. Minimum 12 hour days, no breaks, managers bothering you to work faster and harder, no manager appreciation, something always wrong with the truck you gotta drive around, cameras inside the truck so they know youâre working always, lying in interviews. Tell you they work 4 days a week, 10 hours max, lots of breaks and time to have meetings is a bold faced lie.",1
175,"While working as a unit lead in the same department for 4+ years, I attempted to move up in the company. This lead to me being informed that I had absolutely no leadership skills and could not move up. Having devoted much time, effort and skills to my team I was left empty handed and felt like all of my hard work amounted to nothing. The raises and compensation do not compare to surrounding jobs at different companies for the same type of work.",1
100,"I'm currently a sub staff, but I loved working there full time. It was a great place to work. I fully enjoyed my experience with them. Good pay and felt appreciated.",1
37,Great teamwork and recognition. Workload and metrics are achievable but intense. Easy to burn out. Lots of internal competition for open roles. Leadership training was not consistently required. ,1
291,Working for this company is the best move ever. They care about their staff and look to motivate you. Competitive salaries and staff stay happy. Corporate is engaged with management so the communication is awesome!,1
180,Sad to say the Union UFWC 1996 and company are in Kahootz. This place is pure Duval Dumpster Juice. Management on the HR floor are No good and stink just like a barnhouse,1
250,"I currently work here and the environment is horrible at times leaders are allowed to disappear during the night for hours while I'm forced to find solutions to problems I shouldn't have to ,you have clerks that throw you under the bus to advance themselves in their career most of the time they do it out of pure spite the only person you can trust is yourself! It's also alot of severe multitasking where many mistakes are made because of it team work is not happening here at least not for me ",1
199,*i learned how to create a indipendant strong in mailroom office as a officer under the pressure. * i do beyone the call of duty by seeking out and following up on additional responsibilities and contribute frequently to department meetings. * is not any harders part on work all are easy to understand and i like the management team about the management system * workpalce enviroment are very productive,1
121,"Freelancing with Upwork has given me an opportunity to ""meet"" and work with many different types of people. I have definitely learned a lot about how to best interface with clients for a mutually satisfying project.",1
282,Not much help from upper management long hours no breaks rude customers not enough pay for what they have you do employees calling out no back up forced to work long hours ,1
34,"ManagementIn general, managers at AutoNation only care about their pay check. They will pack the shop with unexperienced techs to bring the productivity up. Then find and excuse to fire them in the slow season. They want you to bend over backwards for them but don't expect the same from them.",1
248,"This is a recruiting company 1st, then an insurance agency 2nd. They falsely advertise positions to get you to apply, make promises they can never keep, but they are hiring groups of people of a weekly basis so their model is working for them...but it will not work for you. It's full commission, however your upline will try and control (for their benefit, not yours) your day by day activities and total outbound calls. Leads are scarce and often very poor. Almost always are recycled and working leads that were called and even closed a month ago. They also promise high commissions when in reality it is only about 50% and 10yrs to be fully vested when industry average is over 100% and vested from day 1. Go get paid what you're worth somewhere else.",1
255,"This place is a literal cult. I only stayed as long as I did due to making so many friends and not having a single second to ever think or reflect on what I was doing ( a typical work day was 7am and at times I was still up at 12pm, usually worked 7 days a week). There is potential to make good money and I did for awhile, but at the risk of being screwed over by higher ups and writing policies at the HIGHEST premiums available, and being trained to continually lie to customers. They are 100 years behind every other insurance company and policies are trailed for diabetes and can take months to get an answer. After leaving, my pending policies commissions went to my upline, and the agency owner placed a vector in my name for chargebacks (which would have been paid off by my approved policies) TWO days after leaving the company to try to prevent me from getting appointed with another company. If you are new to insurance, you typically receive a bill in the mail and are given time to pay it off before getting reported to vector. Managers would purposefully ignore customers calls requesting to cancel or change policies. Just dont do it. ",1
148,"The only good thing about this place is that after 90 days you can request and modify your schedule. There are so many detailed expectations for all agents and you must maintain a score of 94 percent which isnt impossible when the software they use for captioning is OLD and very slow. I wish they would have spent a little more money on developing a better program that doesnt get stuck and fail us everyday and gets worse as call volume increases. And yes agents are tested on calls and regardless of their choppy software, slow computers and non working headsets. they show no sympathy when you fail your weekly tests due to technical issues. High expectations with tools to do the job that RARELY are functional. ",1
164,"Work at adventhealth centra care, area manager not to be trusted. She will tell you something and you know its not true. Coworkers are ok when not on their phone but with Covid definitely no time for that. ",1
190,I enjoyed working during my tenure @ Microsoft. Get to experience first hand experience as Microsoft resource to engage with Microsoft client. Understanding the business relation from Microsoft standpoint.,1
63,"Coworkers were nice, management couldnt get their act together to save their lives, to much work for only 2 people, no life/work balance, major time crunch with way to much work, GA office is the redhead step child.",1
227,"There is favoritism, and so much drama. which includes management, If you are not on the favorite list you will not get any opportunities to move forward. So much drama. For the amount of work expected the pay is below average.",1
189,No complaints. It does require sales. I currently work from home and it not bad. We do have to be in zoom at times for meetings. They do give you computer equipment ,1
5,"Work sites was interesting, me great people that gave me a broader look on different aspects of careers and life. Good for part-time income but that about it.",1
89,"Iâd definitely go back and work... easy pay and easy staff, less pressure and cool customers. Iâve worked here for a years on and off and would definitely return",1
194,Unrealistic call handling time. Cut bonuses. No work life balance. It was very stressful however this was years ago so they may have improved some of their policies ,1
208,Good company easy to work with stay focused a lot of sick time consuming but very easy to work with . A lot of people and coworkers are nice easy work place to adjust to,1
24,"First internship was this past summer with MFC, my team was super helpful even in a virtual environment giving me all the resources and tools needed to be a valuable contributor to the team. Management was always easy to talk to and the company values its interns. ",1
78,I only worked at the property for 6 shifts and almost every shift the sheriff's department would be at our property for one reason or another. The staff is also disrespectful to management and guests.,1

Let's come & join Ibex and enjoy the company of bright young people!",1
270,"Whatever you do at L3, you're probably doing it totally wrong. The management expects absolute perfection, which doesn't exist. If your supervisor isn't screaming, then it's QC, or the DCMA. No support system in place, and 5 million regulations. I have over 25 years experience, and was treated as a fresh A&P mechanic. The only reason I lasted as long as I did was to get my Secret Clearance. Also, be aware of the union. Take my advice, just don't work here. Awful.",1
183,"Most of the account managers are nothing more than pen-pushers. Their main goal is the numbers of the account performance. The safety directors, at least the one i dealed with, do not have a clue and they are not willing to listen. ",1
147,"Management canât count to 10. You will get maximum 20 hours a week, and schedules the day before you go in. Donât work here if you want consistency or to know when youâre working. ",1
6,"Clinic is constantly short staffed and management does not look for coverage to help the clinic. No hazard pay for working with positive covid 19 patients. Costly health insurance with bad coverage. New employees start and quit right away without finishing training, low starting wages compared to other dialysis companies.",1
210,Horrible place to work. My director dont know how to speak to the employees. He always speaks down to people. He has countless complaints against him but HE IS Protected by Admin. ,1
56,"I like working here because it is a teaching hospital. There are residents, fellows and attendings so there is support and many perspectives. A provider is typically accessible. They have residency for new grad RNs. ",1
191,"great place to work. management was ok, definitely an easy job. The calls were easy to handle and training was so much fun, only thing is that management really felt like they micromanaged ",1
62,Poor management. Trucks always break down. Union is a joke. Lots of nonsense to deal with. Routes come and go. Over time is based on rate pay. Not a safe environment.,1

212,"REMX is a subsidiary of Remedy Staffing, LLC. I was thankful they hired me. I needed a job with weekly pay. I wanted an Inside Sales job, and got one.",1
105,"This place runs ok with no management. They simply don't care anything about you, it is just all about production. Becoming more like a sweat shop everyday. They keep adding to the work load and either no raises or some cases dropping pay. Department manager has no class.. Both department could do better if they actually sat down and listen to the employees. If you have a problem and need HR assistance, might as well forget about that, you will get the run around and no answers. Great coworkers to work with but could use more teamwork skills. ",1
265,"Fun, steady paced work environment. Mostly trouble shooting for clients to help them access their QL accounts or guiding the client through the QL site in order to get their 1098 printed.",1
79,When you join the company you are awed at the point when they say you can make six figures while working like your own boss. Then you realize it is all compensation based with no base income. The customers are rude and the contacts are disorganized. You call people from the system that are annoyed and already canceled their policies. There is a lot of turnover and honestly I wish I came to my senses sooner. ,1
49,Good Benefits. Competitive pay. Growth opportunities. Lots of locations. Very corporate environmental. Diverse. Strong leadership. Good coworkers. Nice. ,1
12,"Workplace culture is extremely variable and dependent on advisor. Personal experience would have been more positive and productive if PI was held responsible for their expected duties. Scheduling meetings, editing manuscripts, and troubleshooting experiments was very difficult and when I approached management about the situation my only recourse was to accept or change labs.",1
253,Best place in Calhoun County to work. Great benefits. Safe and clean environment. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. I learned something new every day.,1
35,I worked for The Reynolds and Reynolds Company for 3 years. I don't think I met one person that was truly satisfied with their position. My direct supervisor was an emotionally abusive bully. There is no HR department to report the harassment to. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone. The only positive memories I have are the gym and food.,1
178,"Great company to work for, Great benefits and work life balance, dynamic industry, gives opportunity to grow in your career path, has diverse work culture",1
166,"Lots of office politics. Management has not changed in several years, and some departments have high turnover as a result. Great mission-oriented organization, with some outdated ideals and room for improvement. Remote work, and emphasis on protecting employees from COVID by keeping the office closed",1
51,"It is a very sad career and could be depressing. If you make it as a manager, it could be very lucrative. Other than that you are supposed to make tons of calls daily, daily meetings, seminar/learning zoom calls. The amount of work doesnât not compensate for the possible payout. One thing I have to say is that people are great but do not let them influence you with all the promises and dreams that youâll become successful in this job, they make it sound easy but it is not at all! ",1
184,I enjoyed working for this employer. It was a friendly environment. The managers were always close by to help. When working on a call center youâll sometimes get customers who are rude but the management team will always come to your defense and have your back. I left this job for a better opportunity.,1
145,Workplace culture was horrible I didnât like it as a substitute everyone looked to me as someone who wasnât educated enough to complete the job.the hardest part was for me to come in as needed ready to work and the employees werenât accepting or trying to help with the things they knew about there center to inform me ,1
192,"I had a great learning experience at Goldman. It was my first job and I believe it was the right platform to start off in. Huge learning and development initiatives. A learning phase, and opportunities to display what I learnt. Good working environment and constant feedback given. Time flexibility and work from home options available.",1
216,"Most of the employees are awful and lazy. The management is not much better half don't do anything they just sit around talk and have computer work that takes them all day. While no one runs the departments. They all may be nice to the customers but step into the backroom and it's intimidation, retaliation, and a hostile work environment. ",1
296,"My experience with Geico wasnât HORRIBLE, per say. I was there for almost 3 years at the Fredericksburg office. Geico is really a âfend for yourselfâ?workplace, half the time you need help with a policyholder all of the sups are magically in a meeting with management. The metric are extremely unreasonable but it if youâre lucky, youâll get your 62 level and be able to post out to another department that isnât equally as bad. Since I was there, I had 3 sups post. Before I quit, I absolutely loved my sup, he was amazing and genuinely tried to help. But, others honestly donât really care and are rude, especially most of the female supervisors, theyâll go out of your way to make you feel stupid. Keep in mind, if you apply, this isnât a job where you can get âcomfortableâ?and slack off after your training, you have to continuously be meeting the metric standards otherwise they will fire you. Geico also goes through seasons where when they are introducing a bunch of new hires, theyâll fire atleast 40% of the floor to make room.",1
269,"Great place to work, great children. I worked with up to 35 students after school organizing after school activities. Prepared snack, worked on homework. It was a very fun place to work, however it did not pay well. Most of those employed were high school students with hardly any education or common sense.",1
249,Management was not in tune with the employees. Person in charge was not overseeing the work. Employees are under appreciated and overworked. Raises are virtually nonexistent. ,1
205,"Fun place to work, tips are good. Lacking in structure and organization but management tries hard and itâs getting better with new additions. Great place ",1

69,"Job security and advancementI think this is a good company. Just not this department or supervisors. One supervisor is a micro micro manager who accuses you of lying when you provide honest feeedback. Also raises his voice and is extremely difficult. other supervisor is insincere and ineffective, playing favorites and not overseeing her own staffâs quality of work. Zero appreciation for hard , sincere workers.OverallGood company, bad management and they hire and play favorites. Avoid. Choose a different job site at a different department with different management.",1

101,"Facebook hires very very young and extremely bright young people from all over the world. They then provide you with what I felt was an MBA level training in how to work the right way. This included: dealing with conflict (fast feedback), meeting cadences, star charts to evaluate work and get buy-in from peers on priorities, gobs and gobs of information and documents to do your job. BUT, and it's a big but, it is all self-directed. In other words, you must be able to thrive in ambiguity and be motivated to seek out the info you need. It won't be handed to you.",1
185,Low paid job expect to much of you and a lot of favoritism with employees that get paid more when but you are getting paid less but they expect more from you they always have an excuse. They promise a lot but that is all ,1
142,Poor management and treat employees like a number. No training most of the time you have to figure it out on your own. Managers favor those kisses up to them.,1
149,"Good for people starting a first job ..... Or just getting back into the work force. If you seek to build relationships with people, not the job for you. Great for introverts",1

139,"The job itself is very easy and simple. The management is always overtop and critical no matter how much work you do it is never enough while others are lazy and do nothing, it seems as though the management comes down on the hard workers instead to cover the poor ones. The pay per hour is pitiful considering how much the company makes and the physical and mental toll a 30 minute break and two 20s are not enough for the amount of standing and walking you have to do. They say you get paid breaks but you really donât considering you have to come in early and stay later than what would make a 10 hours shift so you are really on an 11 hour shift including you are expected to work exactly until itâs break time then walk to the break room which can be more than a 5 minute walk and be back working at the exact time your break is scheduled to end which really makes it two 10s and a 20. You get very few days off they are unforgiving towards personal situations for every 6 months you get 20 hours paid time off and 40 hours unpaid any time over and you get terminated. This time off includes all situations including court, care for children or family, and vacation. The managers will talk down and never really answer any questions you have only giving a generic or basic response which gives you little to no information. I urge anyone who wants to work here only do it seasonly do not make it a career I am in college trying to make some money and they very unforgiving when it comes to your personal life or problems.",1
115,Itâs all about your work ethic. A job is a commitment. I went to work and did my job. My supervisors were helpful and stood up for me any time I had an issue. I enjoyed my time with GDIT,1
134,"Currently employed but only due to the pay and benefits, my supervisor is great, the rest of management is horrible. Lots of nepotism in promotions, unsafe work environment, you feel no value as an employee, zero engagement from management, seems bad behavior is rewarded and good behavior is over looked.

80,"It is a good Job. I am an SMT Operator and make, as of 10/18/20, $17.35 per Hour. The managers and leaders are nice but the decisions they make half the time dont make since and wind up being less efficient. There are coolers to put your lunch box in and the cafeteria is open Mon-Thur 6am-2pm. You have to pay for food but they serve many things for breakfast and lunch. It is a bit overpriced but there are fast food places near by. The Shifts are:1st Mon-Thur am 10 hrs, 2nd Mon-Thur pm hrs, 3rd Fri-Sun am 12hrs, 4th Fri-Sun pm 12hrs. You get paid progressively more to work 2nd, 3rd, and 4th shift then 1st shift BUT you wind up making the same salary because you work less hours. Overtime is usually available for a 1st and 2nd shift workers but 3rd and 4th usually have a very hard time getting overtime since 1st and 2nd shift have enough people but 3rd and 4th shift have very little people. They are mostly willing to train you on new things, which is nice if you want more ability to work overtime in other areas of the factory. You get 2 paid 15min breaks and 1 un-paid 30min lunch. Also it is very difficult to get fired. If you are late every day, Miss a day or 2 (no call no show), dont work very hard, and/or just call in once in a while they seem to not fire anyone unless you do something very bad like: Sleep on the Job, Harassment, Disrespect the Managers. ect.",1

You are monitored to the second on your breaks, lunch, and clock in time.The managers I had were incredible and nice, they were willing to work with you. The upper management sucked and the work culture was terrible. It has an incredible turnover rate. Overall it's clear what they expect and if you can stick it out until you get promoted off the call floor you're fine. ",1
133,"I hate to give a bad review to the company, because the company as whole seems to be genuinely a good company to work. However, the site I was located at was the complete opposite. Management (excluding the site supervisor) was full of a bunch of hypercritical, non professional individuals who enforced their political beliefs and own made up rules into effect. As for HR and payroll, they were extremely unorganized and were non responsive when you needed to get a hold of them. The short 4 months I worked there I was only issued one shirt that was a pass-down from a former employee which was a 4XL shirt that was way to big on me and I had to purchase the steel-toed boots and pants. Nonetheless, a new supervisor was hired a month after me and received all of their uniforms as well as steel toed boots not even two weeks of working there. If you are going to work for Allied in Farmington, I suggest not working at Westmoreland SJM and to not depend on HR for anything to get done.",1

The schedule changes almost every day, and you rarely get to leave when your shift is supposed to be over. Leadership is unorganized, bad at communication, unsupportive, and overall petty and rude. They talk about staff members behind their backs, then get passive aggressive and rude when you donât let them walk all over you. Although they offer benefits, they do not have a great health insurance plan. Most employees are very unsatisfied, which creates a negative work environment. Overall, I would not recommend working here.",1
128,I worked here for a little while and quit abruptly when my manager started to bully and intimidate me.

In other areas, there is more of a concern about rocking the boat. I don't understand some of the advancement decisions that have been made. While NM is focused on employee engagement, there seems to be a lack of focus on change management to support innovation and transformation.I think that NM wants to do the right thing for both clients and employees, but with an organization of this size, it's hard to effectively implement that at all levels.

Call center metrics like the amount of time you spend on calls, customer satisfaction and privacy protection of customer data as well as the quality of the data that you enter into the records management software must be met. You will be held accountable to meet those numbers or you should to expect to keep your job. Customers get surveys and if they are not satisfied then that means you either do 2 things, follow what you were taught or expect to be let go. Although sometimes you cannot help a bad survey from a customer do to them just clicking the wrong button on the survey you should try to fix your overall numbers by making most of your customers happy. This can be stressful. Like looking at your bank account number and getting stressed out you can check your metrics and get stressed. Hope to have a great leader that knows how to help you or help yourself and resolve to make customers smile. Tools can be a mess as in the Customer Records Management and Virtual Private Network used has issues and it can look like its your internet when its not or your records management when its not.

My biggest issues came in the low wages. Some new hires were being paid more than me after having been with the company for almost 5 years. One year I only got an 8 cent raise...who does that? I was promised on more than one occasion that I would be trained as a lead for an open position at my site, then was overlooked for an outside hire or an internal promotion of a teenager.I know that most of my bad experiences with the company were mostly due to my store leader, but it was frustrating to say the least when he was my only resource for advancement.As with all retail/customer service positions there were those customers that were difficult to deal with, or downright entitled feeling. Company policy was always to appease for return business. Even in the face of blatant theft.My schedule was never set. I worked fluctuating hours based on trying to be fair to all hourly employees. Even the partime employees who said they could only work specific days and hours. If you are full time then you are to available full time, unless you request time off. Those time off requests are first come first serve.I enjoyed the spirit of the holidays and the push to sell toys for donations to our charities, but our manager could be competitive and narrow sited during these times.In the end I believe that if the company weren't so big and constantly changing ownership it would have been a lifetime job for me, butÂ -Â more...",0

Even if people didn't really like each other they still worked as a team to get things accomplished when necessary. Front office management was something different.

Questioning this 'very simple directive' or missing a day appears to make a difference as to if you are kept on long-term. This is staffing agency - they don't have to keep you and can easily replace you! There are alot of people without jobs due to the pandemic - are you really going to risk be unemployed right now?

My training lasted only 2 days which was exclusively on a cash register. On day 3 I started being sent around the district to help other stores solve problems and trouble shoot issues. Prepping them for inventories, working their freight, setting their planograms, etc. After 7 weeks of this I was placed in a store as the ""acting"" store manager of that location. This location was being run by the assistant manager who was working way to many hours due to the supervisors and part of the rest of the staff calling in every week. Nothing had ever been done about the attendance issues and the AM was working overtime constantly. I arrived and started weeding them out and fixing things with the AM. This went on for a while and once I would eliminate an attendance issue another attendance issue would be sent to me from another store. Yet all the while you would be expected to keep the same workload happening anyway. I finally got the store set up with reliable people along with the AM and a couple of more dedicated workers and got them trained. However, it took a long while to get the problems out of the way because no process was ever started to deal with them from the beginning. After 3 1/2 months of running this location I was never made the official store manager and another opportunity was offered to me that seemed like it would likely become what I was being told more that where I was.

228,"The environment is great for someone who is an extrovert. The seating is an open floor plan. Do not expect to have any sort of privacy or be spared of everyone's discussion of their weekend plans/events.

At times there is no clear management and management does not get to finish everything that they are supposed to do since they are spread so thin. One manager with 15 employees who have questions but the manager is on calls more than half the day. You have to park your questions and wait until they are available. There are a lot of advancement opportunities for the right type of person. You have to be ready to kiss up to people you would never talk to just so they can give you a helping hand to get you into a position that you are already overqualified for. Even if you have the right degree and the right amount of experience, you won't get very far if you're not willing to network, network and network some more. Every phone call is a networking opportunity (that is how it is presented). Even in your own department, you have to speak up. If you don't speak up, you're considered borderline mentally disabled. In one of the company's videos, I heard that GS is a meritocracy and it could not be further from the truth. People in higher positions literally do not have the appropriate academic background to be in those positions, but they got there through networking. You can go far with a high school diploma if you know how to play the game.There are noÂ -Â more...",0

234,If you like change this is the job for you. They are always trying to improve the processes. They are always trying to improve care for their members. They are focused on productivity of the employees. Every morning we have a huddle. At midday and at the end of the day we have check ins to keep track of productivity. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the reviews. The best part of the job is the great team of nurses. ,0
238,Great place to work! Not much room for advancement in my department but I enjoy working here. My manager is very flexible with my schedule. Overall not a bad place to plant your feet in.,0

240,"CVS took Aetna downhill. Took holidays, changed pto and vacation, took our yearly incentive towards our HSA and now it comes in your check each pay. Lots of people now working at home so the office is a ghost town ",0
242,"Mandatory 12 hour days and 8+ on Saturdays. Then they layoff 1/2 the team because they ""transfer"" those positions out of state. Telling the rest of the team our jobs are safe....4 weeks later our jobs are gone. Before that I loved my team we were a family but there was such a high turn over because of the hours. ",0

244,"I really enjoy the hiring process. It seems easy. However, if you are an international individual and English is not your first language, then ""GOOD LUCK!!"" If you have an accent, ""GOOD LUCK!"" Everything was good but I always felt out of place because dictating in English was very hard especially when Dragon(software they use for dictation) didn't really pick up how I speak in English with my pronounciation. I'm glad I made friends there and the mentors were cool and chill. At the same time, the atmosphere is weird like nobody talks to another even during break. Soo if you like your own space and love practicing social distance at its maximum level, then this job is for you! Give it a try but don't quit your other job unless you can handle the verbatim lifestyle",0
245,"Fine, good paying. High stressful hours. Overall it was a good stepping stone fir a career but not a great place to be long term. I was happy to find something else",0
246,Great place to start and pick up some useful skills. Can be slow to promote and increase pay despite having bi-annual review periods with a raise. Passion is not really rewarded here very much. Rarely is there much occasion to work with bleeding edge technology.,0
251,Would stay but they cut out overtime and can't live on 40 hours a week it's a good company I've bin there over 20 years but no overtime is a 30 thousand a year pay cut can't stay for that,0

261,"The location I worked at had too many shoppers from 5 surrounding cities which already had a large Kroger store. The work was okay, but sometimes the managers acted superior to you. Management overlooks you when it's break-time. ",0

263,"A typical day at crossover for work is to login in the worksmart tool and start working. The duties need to be entered on the crossover website on a daily basis, what will you accomplish of the tasks in that particular day. Then following the duties till EOD. Hardest part of the job is that you are unfamiliar what will happen tomorrow, in the view of what new will be implemented to work additionally.Since many operations are already provided to schedule the duties on the site and to work on the customer incidents, which are not easy when troubleshooting hard cases for highly ranked customers (Fujistu, etc.). Additionally writing knowledge base articles, planning customer contacts in calendar and providing training materials and answering other questions on skype which I managed to do on a daily basis for over 2 years. Also no other shifts are possible so I worked always with no change from 3 AM EDT to 12 PM EDT. The most enjoyable part for me is to help the customers, that was the main reason I was hired to provide support for clients, to be a support agent. For me it is fun to schedule customer contacts in calendars, take phone calls and to call, contact the customer. Primarely to help them and to listen to there issues. Traning and knowledge base articles should be created by content writers and trainers coaches, not from my end. The managemt could prioritize and assign some specific roles and duties to particular agents. This would have increased the work effectivness and better planning.",0

284,I enjoyed my co-workers and its diversity! My great days were feeling independent while driving. I also like the guaranteed hours and being flexible if you need time off. I don't like being paid by the loads. The dispatch having authority of how many loads to give you affects your pay because its not given equally.They actually favorite certain Men. I worked 50.14 hrs w/16 loads and was paid less for 50 hrs w/15 loads. Their Chinese method of paying their Employees is a rip off. THE PAY SUCKS! The Managers can't care about trying to make a change because they have so much responsibility and only have enough Authority to simply go by the book. They need more departments.,0
286,"Costco is a very fast pace environment. Must be ready for anything, and must be able to work quickly and efficiently. The member is always right and basically if they want it, they got it. We were basically thrown right into work on our first day, no training or anything. You get the hang of things pretty quickly, you don't really have any other choice. If you are a slow mover, this may not be the place for you. Urgency is key. Management can be disorganized sometimes which can get frustrating. Love my coworkers, you can create lasting friendships if you want to do so. On an 8 hour shift you get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. You will be on your feet all day long, so make sure to wear comfortable shoes too.",0
290,I love the company and what they stand for. It's a hard job but we should all work hard to better ourselves. Work life balance is always a challenge but would rather be busy than not. ,0

295,Can be positive to work for the right person who is willing to grind out 100% commission all of the time. Always have to have continuous growth. The problem is following construction growth.,0
