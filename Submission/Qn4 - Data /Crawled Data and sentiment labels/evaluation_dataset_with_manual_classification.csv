Banks and Financial Services,79,"Amazing organization that has deep rooted ethics based on the idea of ""always doing what is right"". ","Alot of job ads say ""uncapped earning potential"" or ""uncapped commission"" to draw folks in but rarely is that relevant for 90% of new hires. However at Quicken Loans you can truly bust your butt and earn a life changing amount of money within your first year. If you can pass the licensing exam and stick it out for the first few months of banking the rewards that follow seem truly endless. After my first 12 calendar months at the company (with the first 4 months not writing loans) I have cleared close to $200,000. With the opportunity to earn such an incredible living, the job does require dedication, flexibility, humility, and the willingness to do what is needed or to go the extra mile to get the job done. The common sleight against the company would be the hours. I typically work about +/- 60 hours a week in addition to clients frequently calling and texting my cell phone while off the clock. This sacrifice is very easy to justify once you start to see success, which can come very fast. I would highly recommend any friends or family to interview at QL. Whether it is for a position in banking, or the thousands of support positions between the family of companies, the opportunity for growth and change is limitless. For the first time in my professional career I can say I have absolute faith in my employer to do right by not only myself but also for each client we interact with.

Food and Beverages,3757,Decent job,"It's a very average job. It's not horrible, but it's not amazing either. If you're looking for a temporary job, this is probably a good option for you. Most in stores work dinner rushes, so in a typical day at work you'll most likely be assigned to either the makeline or the front. On makeline you'll just be making pizzas and putting them in the oven. It's not hard work after your first week, and you'll have all of the recipes memorized within 2 weeks. If you forget something, there's laminates posted on the wall to help you out. If it's really busy, you might be assigned to cut. All you have to do is take pizzas (and other items) out of the oven, put them in the box, cut them/sauce them, and put them on the hot rack. Cut can be stressful because the conveyor belt oven doesn't stop, so if you wait too long the pizza will fall on the floor. Finally there's the front of the store, where you'll be responsible for answering phones, doing curbside service (during covid), putting stickers on boxes, etc. Also not hard work, but the system isn't great so it's easy to make mistakes. (For example, if a customer places an online/phone order and chooses to pay when they arrive, the order will be marked as cash. If they give you a card when they arrive, you have to delete the cash option and put in the card, but if you accidentally complete the order, it messes with the whole system.)

Managers with experience, knowledge of the job market and demographic of their area, and proven skills to grow the company were let go and a new, younger group of ""managers and leaders"" were brought in to replace them. The new ""leaders"" had little to no understanding of the job, and were relying on the employees to run things. It was explained to them how the operations were handled and proven successful for years, but they still decided they knew better and completely changed the way the company operated. People not from the area with no knowledge of the job market, and no willingness to study the data, made decisions that negatively affected the company and their employees; both internal and contracted. The more pushback from the ones who knew this would negatively affect the company, the more changes (firings/repremands) were made. Morale was at an all time low.

You will be held accountable to meet those numbers or you should to expect to keep your job. Customers get surveys and if they are not satisfied then that means you either do 2 things, follow what you were taught or expect to be let go. Although sometimes you cannot help a bad survey from a customer do to them just clicking the wrong button on the survey you should try to fix your overall numbers by making most of your customers happy.

They say you get paid breaks but you really donât considering you have to come in early and stay later than what would make a 10 hours shift so you are really on an 11 hour shift including you are expected to work exactly until itâs break time then walk to the break room which can be more than a 5 minute walk and be back working at the exact time your break is scheduled to end which really makes it two 10s and a 20. You get very few days off they are unforgiving towards personal situations for every 6 months you get 20 hours paid time off and 40 hours unpaid any time over and you get terminated. This time off includes all situations including court, care for children or family, and vacation. The managers will talk down and never really answer any questions you have only giving a generic or basic response which gives you little to no information.

Industrial Manufacturing,14092,Great Product and Co-Workers but Lacking Clear Career Progression Opportunities,"The Good: There is an opportunity to have an impact day one. New hires are expected to contribute immediately and aren't saddled with busy work. Design teams are collaborative and involve a large amount of hands on testing. As a new-hire, there are opportunities to rotate through different teams to build out your exposure and experience. Exposure and training on various tools is also a perk.The Bad: Management decisions regarding the company's core objectives is often reactive to stock market fluctuations. Very little contingency is factored into the business' operating plan. In a market downturn, expect to see a re-org, reductions in force, and/or forced retirements. If you are lucky enough to keep your job, expect changes in your designated project or role within the company. In addition to this, the re-orgs at times are so frequent (every 4-6 months) that you often never finish a project completely. This leaves many employees in a situation where their new supervisor has no visibility to their past work contributions. As a result, the clock is reset on your track to a promotion. Combine this with the seemingly consistent freeze on merit increases, and you have the recipe for bad morale and high turn-over. I have only stayed around this long (10+ years) because I enjoy the people I work with and the product. Unfortunately, more and more of those familiar faces are leaving due the management and HR decisions.Overall a good company to get started at and build experience but lacking in a clear path for career advancement.",Project Engineer (Current Employee) ," Towson, MD "," October 8, 2020",https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Stanley-Black-&-Decker/reviews?start=40,Neutral

Senior leadership is insistent on fostering a ""resilient"" staff without providing the resources necessary - honesty, accountability, robust benefits to name a few. Workloads are all over the place. Some salaried employees are expected to work regular business hours and put in an additional 10-20 hours/week. An employee was publicly shouted down by their supervisor for pointing out they were being overworked. Leadership protects bullies. Employees outside of KC HQ are left without the resources and support they need to do their job. VPs in External Affairs are out of touch with the staff reporting to them. Pay rationale is opaque and salary ranges are inconsistent. Financial issues are cited as a reason for pay stagnation and low wages, while senior leadership makes hundreds of thousands of dollars.

They allocate 12.4 seconds per task. Upon committing to the project you find that there are additional steps for each task not mentioned previously, making it physically impossible to do in 12.4 seconds per task. Over 21 tasked, i averaged about 1 minute per task which pushed the average project time out to 14 hours. I immediately abandoned the project. A quick google search finds others who have the same project also complaining about the times being not possible. One poster wrote they rushed the project as quick as they could and it still took them 7 hours to complete. All emails to report the issue and explain the additional times are ignored. They know it's not possible to complete the project in the paid time allocated.

What makes it even more frustrating is they score 5 of the phone calls you made in a month and rate it on a points system. Youâre pretty much failing if you score less than 96 points, which in turn counts toward how much of a raise you will receive at the end of the year. You get dinged on pretty much EVERYTHING.
