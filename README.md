## üß© Project Components
1. **Data Crawling**
   - Collected reviews of top-paying companies by industry.
   - Focused on formal review content, minimizing noise like emojis and slang.

2. **Indexing and Search**
   - Preprocessed text using **NLTK** (tokenization, stemming, cleanup).  
   - Built **Elasticsearch inverted index** for near-real-time full-text search.  
   - Developed a simple **UI** with bar charts, line charts, histograms, word clouds, and interactive search.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Created training, validation, and test sets with labeled data.  
   - Compared embedding methods: **BERT outperformed BoW**, capturing context effectively.  
   - Evaluated models: Multinomial Naive Bayes, SVM, XGBoost, and BERT.

4. **Enhanced Classification**
   - Applied **ensemble methods** (majority voting, stacking with logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost).  
   - **Best results:** 94.3% accuracy for polarity detection, 73.5% for subjectivity detection.
